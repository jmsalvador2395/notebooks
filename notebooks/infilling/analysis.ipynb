He makes a joking reference to Jenner\\'s transition while speaking with Pascal While discussing his upcoming film Aloha, which stars an all-star cast that includes Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Rachel McAdams, and Alec Baldwin, Pascal asked Crowe if he had anything to show her from the movie in October 2014. Crowe\\'s response to this was; \"DOES BRUCE JENNER WANT BOOBS? HELL YES I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU!!!! (looking at tuesday).\" It was revealed in previous leaked emails that Pascal is now fan of Crowe\\'s upcoming film, writing in one email; \\'I\\'m never starting a movie again when the script is ridiculous. I don\\'t care how much I love the director and the actors. It never, not even once, ever works.\\' She also said of the movie; \\'People don\\'t like people in movies who flirt with married people or married people who flirt.\\' Crowe has yet to respond to this leaked email. \\n\\n Meanwhile, the two are discussing Crowe\\'s upcoming film Aloha (above), which stars Emma Stone and Bradley Cooper. Jenner meanwhile is set to discuss his transition in an upcoming interview with Diane Sawyer.
