Even more importantly, Van Gaal's side are now eight points clear of Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool in fifth. It means his number one priority, restoring Champions League football to Old Trafford, has nearly been achieved. In terms of performance, it was something of the old, something of the new. United used width as their tradition demands with former Villa winger Ashley Young seeing a lot of the ball on the left. But there was a lot of patience and possession too. United had 72% of the ball without a lot to show for it until the reward came after 43 minutes. Daley Blind overlapped for the umpteenth time and on this occason his cutback to Herrera was perfect for the Spaniard to drill home. The second goal didn't arrive until 11 minutes from the end but was worth the wait. Angel Di Maria, on as a substitute, chipped the ball behind Rooney, but the England striker still found a way to score. He fully extended his left luminous green boot, brought the ball under control with his first touch and then spun 180 degrees to lash home his finish on the half-volley with his right.

That’s not to say this was a bad day for Everton. They have had plenty of those in this long season over land and sea and could yet finish in the lower half of the Premier League for the first time since 2006. But this one frustrated the Spaniard. His side have found a degree of freedom since their European travels came to an end and in winning three on the trot they started to resemble the side that blitzed their way through last season. Jonjo Shelvey converted from 12 yards to rescue a point for Swansea after Seamus Coleman handled in the penalty box .

Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball, according to the watching Michael Oliver . Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting section at the full-time whistle . This game, in the mind of Martinez but not many others, should have been the fourth win of a streak. The contentious moment came in the second half when, having led through Lennon’s first-half strike, they conceded a penalty. Seamus Coleman was under pressure from Marvin Emnes, fell forward under marginal contact and then handled the ball. Martinez called for a foul on Coleman; Michael Oliver called a penalty for handball and Jonjo Shelvey buried the kick. Everton’s manager seethed as three points became one and then gave the kind of comments that suggested this fixture was not the dead rubber it appeared to be. ‘We feel like it was a defeat,’ he said. ‘It is difficult to take. I am very satisfied with the performance because they are a difficult side to play. Look at the way they open teams up like Arsenal and Manchester United. ‘For the first 20 or 25 minutes of the second half it was too easy. We just couldn’t find the second goal. You are exposed at 1-0 and something happened. ‘Seamus felt there was contact. Seamus loses his balance and as he falls he ends up touching the ball with his hand. There was no goalscoring threat whatsoever. The referee in those moments can make his own decision but I think it was very harsh. ‘He should have applied a bit of common sense. From my point of view, seeing it in a biased way, I would have wanted to see a free-kick awarded. Two or three actions straight after it was exactly the same and given as a free-kick.

Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, of Georgia and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, of Alabama were charged on Friday with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators relating to the incident that occurred between March 10-12, according to Bay County Sheriff's Office. According to WFSA, it has been confirmed by university officials that both men were suspended, and Martistee, a promising track star, has been removed from the team. The alleged victim  told deputies she thought she had been drugged before the incident and that she was afraid to report it because she could not remember many details, Panama City News Herald reported. Scroll down for video . Delonte' Martistee, 22, (left) and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, (right) have been charged in connection with the alleged rape after police in Troy, Alabama, found the clip on a cell phone during another investigation .

Calhoun of Mobile, Alabama was suspended from Troy University along with Martistee, university officials confirmed . 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' and likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. Following the incident that occurred between March 10-12, the men were arrested and charged on Friday and were taken to the Bay County Jail as they await their first appearance . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. ______ The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media.

And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach...

As the smoke cleared on this 1-1 draw against bottom side Livingston, though, Stuart McCall was left ruing the explosive impact of Myles Hippolyte despite his Ibrox side nudging one point clear of Hibs in second place. The Livvy attacker’s absolute cracker of a free-kick had sent the home side into the lead just two minutes after the break. Hippolyte’s joy was to be short-lived, though, as Rangers centre-half Marius Zaliukas raced up the park to restore parity with a clever back-header two minutes later. Rangers dropped two points at Championship bottom side Livingston in their bid for promotion . Livingston: Jamieson, Fordyce, Gallacher, Cole, Talbot, Keaghan Jacobs, O'Brien, Pitman (Mullen 86), Kyle Jacobs, White (Boulding 89), Hippolyte (Glen 81).

Goals: Zaliukas 49. Att: 4,345. Referee: Greg Aitken (Scotland). ______ To be fair to McCall, he had pinpointed this clash against a resurgent Livvy as one of the toughest matches his side would face before the end of the regular league season. The Rangers boss made just the one change from the side that beat Raith Rovers 4-0 at the weekend. There was a return to centre-half for captain Lee McCulloch, free from suspension after serving his two-game ban for an elbow on Hearts striker Osman Sow. The captain’s recall saw Darren McGregor move to right back, with Robbie Crawford dropping onto the bench. Livingston, on a run of three straight wins, made just the one change, Danny Mullen dropping out while the veteran Burton O’Brien was included to pack the home midfield. Myles Hippolyte gave Livingston the lead early in the second half and threatened to upset Rangers . Hippolyte curled a free-kick into the back of the Rangers net to give Livingston the lead in the 47th minute . After a series of loud bangs rang out across the stadium, the game exploded into real controversy after seven minutes. Livingston striker Jordan White challenged Rangers goalkeeper Cammy Bell in the air and Hippolyte turned the loose ball home. As he raced away in glee, the Rangers players, not to mention McCall in the dugout, looked grateful as the flag of assistant referee Dougie Potter halted the home celebrations. The Livingston players, and fans, meanwhile, reacted furiously. There had seemed little wrong with White’s challenge on the keeper. Rangers were struggling to impose themselves as an attacking force, against a side that looked nothing like relegation contenders. The best McCall’s men could muster early on was a header over the bar from Nicky Clark after a cross from the right wing by Haris Vuckic. The Slovenian then saw a long-ranger effort comfortably saved by Darren Jamieson in the home goal. But shortly afterwards, Vuckic looked fortunate to escape punishment when he appeared to catch Livvy’s Jason Talbot in the face with his arm. Referee Aitken had spotted the off-the-ball incident but he elected to award a foul to Livvy but took no action against the Slovenian, to the visible disgust of some Livingston players. Keaghan Jacobs sent the free-kick over the bar. Five minutes before the break, Kenny Miller sent a 16-yard shot flying over the bar when he really should have tested goalkeeper Jamieson. In the second half more booms erupted in the Rangers end but they were stunned into silence as the dangerous Hippolyte gave Livingston a lead with a terrific goal. McGregor fouled White at the edge of the box and Hippolyte stepped up to curl a stylish and superb free-kick beyond the diving Bell to leave Rangers players and their fans staring at a damaging defeat. Marius Zaliukas equalised a couple of minutes later for Rangers at the Energy Assets Arena . Rangers were unable to force a second goal and get the win, but still leapfrogged Hibernian in the table . But McCall’s men showed the kind of mettle that has been missing for most of this season when they drew level within 120 seconds. Vuckic sent in a free-kick from the left and there was Zaliukas to get in position to flick a backwards header beyond the diving Jamieson. As Rangers searched for a winner, McGregor fired in a powerful shot from the right wing that Jamieson uncomfortably palmed away. And Rangers thought they had gone ahead when Nicky Law fed Miller on the right, and he cut the ball back for Vuckic. But the Newcastle loan star’s shot cracked the inside of the post before being scrambled away to safety. Rangers survived a scare at the other end when Bell slipped but the goalkeeper recovered before White could take advantage of his fall. And the Livvy fans were furious when Zaliukas appeared to foul Scott Pittman in the box, only for referee Aitken to wave play on. McCall went for it, sending on Kris Boyd and young Ryan Hardie for front two Miller and Clark while Tom Walsh replaced Shiels. But his replacements made no impact and Rangers were unable to carve out any more opportunities. At the death, Vuckic was booked for simulation in the box as he desperately claimed a penalty. There was still time for yet another ear-shattering explosion from the Rangers end. But the booms were soon replaced by boos at the full-time whistle as Rangers had stuttered once more on the road. Livvy, for their part, were afforded a rapturous reception from their own band of fans as Mark Burchill’s men moved to within two points of second-bottom Alloa.","But despite leapfrogging Hibs to go second, there was no mistaking McCall’s expression at full-time. To the manager, this was two points lost as Rangers’ form away from Ibrox once again gave them cause for concern. That’s just one win away from home in the last five Championships games now, as the tense race to finish second — and avoid the third/fourth play-off games — hots up ahead of the final three matches.","The word to be filled is ""boss""",0.8429324627,0.7785933018,0.8094864488,0.0481927711,0.0,0.0481927711,0.0481927711

However since 2012 the BBC commentaries have been reduced to a single commentator, putting more pressure on the likes of Mowbray to be better prepared than ever. Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Liverpool at Anfield on Monday night . Mowbray's notes are more detailed, but less colourful than those produced by another BBC commentator, Nick Barnes, who works for the corporation's Radio Newcastle. Barnes posts some of his notes for Newcastle games on Twitter, complete with his commentary microphone, showing off his artistry as well as his research. The local radio commentator's notebook included hand-drawn kits and national flags for each player, as well as colour-coded notes on the visiting club's form and the predicted line-ups in formation.

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . ______ Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 . Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’",It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months .,"Nathan Hughes, the Fiji-born forward who was suspended by the Welsh rugby team Toulon on March 27 after accidentally knocking out George North's head while scoring a try during a match, had had his appeal on Friday reinstated to remove the three-match ban imposed on him.

He has made 700 professional club appearances and won 81 caps for England, six Premier League titles, the FA Cup and the Champions League. In his pomp, he was the stuff of strikers' nightmares, driving some of the world's greatest goalscorers to distraction with lightning-sharp reactions and an instinctive reading of the game. That's why it's such a shame that what is likely to be Rio Ferdinand's farewell year in the English game has fizzled out. Rio Ferdinand pictured in training at Queens Park Rangers last week. The 36-year-old defender started regularly in the first part of the season but has been unable to hold down his spot in the side . Ferdinand started the first seven matches of QPR's Premier League campaign before being dropped . Ferdinand has enjoyed a fantastic career, winning six Premier League titles, but a fairytale finish is unlikely . Ferdinand and Ryan Giggs lift the European Cup for Manchester United in Moscow back in 2008 . Ferdinand also won 81 caps for England during his glittering career . He would love to be out there, hunting down and hassling opponents, robbing attackers of the ball, winning the aerial duels, playing his part in Queens Park Rangers' survival mission. Keeping them up would be a fitting curtain call. Instead, Ferdinand's season has been one spent on the margins - either suspended, benched or out of the squad altogether. Once again, the 36-year-old was forced to watch on from the sidelines as Rangers claimed a potentially crucial point away to Aston Villa on Tuesday night. Ferdinand had picked up a slight knock and was ruled out. He has played just five times since the start of October - not much of a swansong. On Sunday, he posted a Twitter picture of a pile of chicken bones after lunch at his mum's. He had not been involved in the 4-1 win at West Brom 24 hours earlier and it weirdly seemed to sum up his peripheral role at the moment. By contrast, Ferdinand had started QPR's first seven games of the campaign, lasting the full 90 minutes in all of them. Harry Redknapp had grand plans and the best of intentions last summer. Having called time on his Manchester United career after 12 trophy-laden seasons, Ferdinand moved to Loftus Road in what Redknapp described as a 'remarkable coup for the club.' Harry Redknapp described Ferdinand's signing last summer as a 'remarkable coup' for the club . But after initial promise, Ferdinand has largely spent the season on the bench . Premier League (6): 2002-03, 2006-07, 2007-08, 2008-09, 2010-11, 2012-13 . FA Cup (1): 2003-04 . Football League Cup (2): 2005-06, 2008-09 . FA Community Shield (5): 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013 . Champions League (1): 2007-08 . FIFA Club World Cup (1): 2008 . Even in his mid-thirties, Redknapp believed Ferdinand would bring 'quality, class, experience and know-how' as QPR returned to the top flight. He envisaged Ferdinand in a sweeper role, the central pivot of a three-man defence in an in-vogue 3-5-2 system. He would bring all that experience to bear, helping Clint Hill and Steven Caulker keep opposition attacks at bay. Unfortunately, it just didn't work. In their first seven Premier League games of the season, QPR won one, drew one and lost five. They leaked 15 goals and the scale of their task in staying in the top division was clear. Ferdinand was demoted to the bench, Richard Dunne and Nedum Onuoha were introduced and the dye was cast for the season. His suspension for using the word 'sket' in a tweet didn't help and by the time that was served, Ferdinand was down the pecking order. Ferdinand has shown glimpses of his imperious best for QPR this season . But Ferdinand's farewell season in English football has not lived up to his expectations . Chris Ramsey has played Ferdinand on three occasions since taking over from Harry Redknapp . Queens Park Rangers find themselves two points from safety after their 3-3 draw at Aston Villa on Tuesday . As you would expect, Ferdinand has conducted himself like a model professional on the training ground, maintaining his fitness in case he was called upon. And there have been such occasions, notably the 2-0 win at Sunderland in February - Chris Ramsey's second game in charge after replacing Redknapp, that ended QPR's 11-game losing run on the road. ______ For now, Rio's farewell has sadly fallen a bit flat. The fixtures remaining for the bottom six in the Barclays Premier League .","Ferdinand may yet be called upon again in the run-in, with QPR sitting two points shy of safety, but the season so far will have fallen short of his hopes and expectations.

With more sackings inevitable, Sportsmail asks: Who's next? Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign.

'I went to watch Lancashire v Yorkshire last year - 25,000 people (were there). I was fortunate enough to play in finals day at Edgbaston - a terrific night, even though we lost.

Wilshere has been out of action since suffering the injury in the 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United on November 22 but is finally nearing full fitness. It has been the latest in a succession of injury problems that have hampered his development into the world class player he was expected to become for club and country. Having made a return to action in a reserve friendly with Brentford last week, this was a step up in quality for Wilshere and he exerted a quiet influence without taking a hold on the game. He saw a free-kick 25 yards from goal deflected just over the crossbar early on and initiated a move later in the first-half that culminated in Serge Gnabry firing a snapshot on the turn that was saved the legs of Stoke goalkeeper Daniel Gyollai. Wilshere might have capped his night with a goal but his improvised volley from a Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill cross was saved before Stephy Mavididi slammed home the rebound for Arsenal’s third on 73 minutes. Arteta, who has been on the sidelines since the Champions League game with Borussia Dortmund on November 26, captained the team but failed to make much of an impact during his hour of involvement. Diaby, whose never-ending succession of injuries has seen him absent for an astonishing 226 weeks of his Arsenal career, was arguably their most influential performer as he fights for a new contract. Mikel Arteta was among the players as he stepped up his recovery from an ankle injury . Wilshere runs with the ball during the U21 Premier League match on Tuesday night at the Emirates . With his runs through the centre of midfield, Diaby caused plenty of problems for the Stoke defence and he had two opportunities to get on the scoresheet in his 70 minutes of action. On 17 minutes, a lovely through ball from Gnabry set him clear inside the box but a last-ditch tackle ruined everything and, shortly afterwards, he curled a shot a fraction over the bar from the edge of the area. With the first-teamers mis-firing, it was left to Alex Iwobi to make an impression with two clinical first-half goals that were almost identical and a stoppage time third. On 23 minutes, Iwobi, who is capped for England’s youth teams but likely to play for Nigeria, surged at the Stoke defence, beat two men and fired crisply across the keeper and into the far corner. And he repeated the trick five minutes before the break, locating the same corner from pretty much the same position after latching on to Diaby’s slide-rule pass.

Stubbs, who had seen his team play well but fail to beat Hearts in three previous outings this season, said his players had answered those who asked if they had the bottle to win at the business end of the season. ‘Two weeks ago we were being questioned,’ said Stubbs after goals from Jason Cummings and Farid El Alagui saw them remain level on points with Rangers, who have a game in hand. ‘People were asking if this was the wobble and was this Hibs; season ending again. Alan Stubbs saw his side record a win in the Edinburgh derby to put Hearts' promotion party on hold . ‘Football can change very quickly. Suddenly after two results we are building momentum again. I think the players have always answered the criticism. ‘When you have played well against the champions, as we have done this season, and not got three points, I think it is important. ‘Sometimes it can just linger on and it puts self-doubt in not just the players’ minds but the fans’ minds as well. I was proud of the players today, I really was. They were courageous and brave so I am delighted for them.’ Stubbs singled out El Alagui for special praise. The striker – not long back from seven months out with an achilles injury – played brilliantly before securing victory with his injury-time finish. ‘I’m absolutely delighted for him,’ said the Hibs manager. ‘He has had a really tough seven months, with a horrendous injury. I don’t think people understood just how bad the injury was and the fact he is back playing now is all credit to him.

But the Manchester derby this Sunday still holds great significance for both clubs, managers and, of course, supporters. City have won the last four contests between the sides, as well as the previous three at Old Trafford. A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time. Here Sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers. ______ Manuel Pellegrini (centre) is a man under-pressure at City and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable . Who needs the win more? To that end you would probably have to say City. A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation, and reignite ambitions to finish second, possible saving Pellegrini from the axe. United look set to finish in the top four regardless, the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory. But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours. United have never lost five in a row to City before. Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed. Glenn Murray (right) tormented City at Selhurst Park as they dropped out of the Premier League title race . Would victory dispel any lingering doubts about Louis Van Gaal? Quite likely. Three successive wins on the bounce against opposition the stature of Tottenham, Liverpool and City would underline Van Gaal’s ability to rise to the big matches and suggest that, after a season of trial, error, and turnstile selections, the plan is coming together. Those uncertainties around the Dutchman would resurface just as swiftly with defeat of course. Louis van Gaal has had his critics this season but Manchester United's performances are proving them wrong . Should Vincent Kompany remain in the City side? It would be a big call for a game of such size, but the sense that City may be better off without their captain cannot be disregarded. These should be the 29-year-old’s peak years but injuries seem to have affected his body and mind. The Belgian is increasingly prone to errors of judgement. Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala do not provide the most robust competition but Kompany’s appearance in seven losses in 12 games speaks volumes. Mangala, on the bench against Crystal Palace, has experienced three losses in 24 matches all season. Vincent Kompany (left) has struggled for form this campaign and could lose his place for the derby . Where does this rank in English football’s biggest games? Manchester has become a powerhouse of English football through City’s ascent. The city has been home to the Premier League title for the past four seasons, oscillating between Old Trafford and the Etihad. That will not be the case this year but the rivalry still burns and allied to the global scale of these clubs the match ranks as high as any other, perhaps only beaten by Liverpool-United. Mario Balotelli (centre) produced one of the most iconic derby moments when he scored at Old Trafford . Who is the better player right now: Wayne Rooney or Sergio Aguero? No doubt Aguero is the better striker, his movement, angles for shooting, and goal-scoring record stands testament to that. But since being shifted to his preferred centre-forward role, Rooney is displaying form that would see him into any side. He has been approaching his all-action peak and scored seven goals in ten games for club and country, taking his overall season tally to 21. Aguero has 23 for the campaign, but has failed to find the net in his last six games, a run stretching back to February 24. At the moment you would have to go for Rooney. These two love the Manchester derby. Rooney holds the record for most all-time goals with 11, while Aguero has six in seven. Wayne Rooney (left) and Sergio Aguero are two of the best forwards in the current Premier League . How crucial might Michael Carrick be? His return to the United lineup in the fulcrum role in front of defence has lifted the side considerably. He has not enjoyed the best returns facing City in recent seasons – and in the corresponding fixture was asked to play centre-back as a first-half substitute – but will get more space in his deeper midfield role. It is unlikely Pellegrini will task anyone with marshalling Carrick, which is how he likes it. Michael Carrick (left) has become a key player for United over the years and is pivotal for Van Gaal . Will the real Yaya Toure show up? You would hope so. Yaya at the height of his powers in an awesome sight and could prove the difference. But those flashes have been all too fleeting this season. Now would be a good time to step up. Like Kompany, Yaya Toure's form is patchy but he scored a stunning goal against Crystal Palace on Monday . Will United solve the problem of Angel di Maria? The team looks balanced right now, with Ashley Young doing nothing to lose his place. United’s record signing has been coming on and providing assists, so Van Gaal is probably inclined to repeat the pattern. Ultimately, Di Maria must provide more, and will want to, but at this moment he should start on the bench. Why is kick-off at 4pm? Police saw no dangers of the late afternoon kick-off time on a Sunday, and have cited previous good behaviour between sets of supporters. As ever, television dictates the preference and the 4pm slot is prime for viewers. Angel di Maria hasn't quite settled in Manchester but recently has done well when coming off the bench .","Can Manuel Pellegrini survive a derby loss? The word is the Chilean’s future will be decided come May when the dust on a creaking season has settled. Defeat to cross-town rivals would push chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though. It would leave City trailing United by four points and likely to finish fourth, needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to Champions League – the very minimum requirement.","I can help you fill in the blanks by making some educated guesses.

At the launch of next month's opening of the Natwest T20 Blast Nottinghamshire's Hales admitted: 'As a team we're not hiding behind the fact that we're embarrassed about what happened. With the quality of the squad that we had there's no excuse not to make it out of the group stages.' Alex Hales believes England's players aren't competing in enough Twenty20 competitions . Hales was at Edgbaston on Thursday at the launch of this season's T20 domestic competition . Both he and Woakes feel that a way of improving England's one day cricket would be to adopt more the model of countries like Australia and India with their franchise systems. 'The Big Bash is fantastic, I've played in it for three years and really enjoyed it,' said Hales. 'I'm a big fan of the block system for T20, you dedicate three weeks to a month to hone your skills, all your focus if on T20. In the last couple of years in England I haven't had much of a chance to develop. 'Over here you play something different Sunday to Wednesday, then T20 on Friday so you don't get a huge chance to practice your skills. Over there they have less teams so the standard is fantastic. 'I think that's maybe where we got found out a bit in the World Cup, not many guys get exposed to T20. There's such a heavy schedule of Test matches guys don't get a chance to play domestic T20. Look at guys like Broady and Jimmy (Anderson), they don't get a chance to play for their counties. 'It doesn't help that a lot of our guys don't play in the IPL or the Big Bash. Other players are constantly playing in front of big crowds and improving their skills and that's not something we had in the World Cup. England were thoroughly embarrassed at the 50-over World Cup earlier this year, dumped out of their group . Brendon McCullum is adept at playing T20 all over the world and Hales wants more of that for English stars . 'It's tougher here with the indifferent weather and I don't really know what goes on behind the scenes, but in terms of standard and quality I think the franchise system would work in England.' At Thursday's Edgbaston launch there were players from all 18 counties, but that number would be cut down if the ECB and its new management ever get round to introducing a more city-based league. Woakes, who hopes to start bowling again in the next two weeks after recent foot problems, will play alongside McCullum for a Warwickshire team now styled as the Birmingham Bears. ______ It would improve the standard of cricket, it might not feel right but eventually it would. 'It's a tricky one, you would have to get counties to merge. Some players might benefit and others wouldn't. Some people are going to be unhappy. I don't think counties would be shut down but if franchises are going to happen something has to give.' Advanced ticket sales are said to be up 41 per cent on last year ahead of the May 15 start with other overseas stars in action including Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Finch, Chris Gayle and Kumar Sangakarra.","He believes the rebranding added to the support they received last season, and could so elsewhere if replicated: 'As a player you felt like there were more people behind you,' he said. 'It might attract more people to come to the ground from different areas of the city, they might feel more part of it. 'I'm sure if it happened it wouldn't feel right at first but I bet the Big Bash didn't feel right at first, everything moves forward and evolves. I think it would probably be a good thing.",the ......,0.797644496,0.7874572277,0.7925181389,0.0210526316,0.0,0.0210526316,0.0210526316

Toulon captain Hayman admitted Bernard Laporte's men were distinctly underwhelmed by their performance levels in Sunday's 32-18 quarter-final victory over Wasps. The Cote d'Azur outfit had Frederic Michalak's unerring boot and Ali Williams' late try to thank for a victory littered with error and inaccuracy. Guy Thompson is tackled by Ali Williams during the European Rugby Champions Cup quarter final match . Toulon will host Leinster at Marseille's Stade Velodrome on Sunday, April 19 in the last four, with Hayman conceding vast improvements are required to lift the inaugural Champions Cup. 'If we want to be in London for the final we've got a lot of work to do,' said Hayman. 'If we're honest with ourselves that was nowhere near what we expect against Wasps, and we're going to have to make big improvements quickly.

Williams celebrates a try with his Toulon teammate Delon Armitage at the Felix Mayol Stadium . In Sunday's unstructured and sloppy attempts at swashbuckling, Toulon clearly craved the hard-nosed and direct influence of a certain Jonny Wilkinson. England's World Cup-winner's summer retirement leaves a clear void at Stade Mayol, especially when Matt Giteau is missing through injury. The former Australia pivot returned via the bench at the weekend, leaving Michalak to lead an at times befuddled line. Williams dives over to score a last minute try during the  quarter final match between Toulon and Wasps . New Zealand tighthead Hayman believes Giteau's return to fitness will offer a timely extra level of focus to Toulon's approach. Hayman is set to retire at the end of the season, with the 35-year-old currently completing coaching courses in France with a view to launching an off-field career in Europe. The 45-cap All Black admitted: 'I won't burn my boots' at the end of the season however - keeping himself available in the autumn just in case New Zealand suffer a front-row injury crisis at the World Cup in England. Drew Mitchell  is tackled by Alapati Leiua during the match between Toulon and Wasps at Felix Mayol Stadium . Armitage  is tackled by James Haskell  and Matt Mullan during the game at the Felix Mayol Stadium . 'We always try to look for width on the ball and balance that with our power game, so we'll look to continue that, but we've got to make better decisions on the field,' said Hayman. 'Little mistakes, penalties at the scrum, they cost us, and that hurt us. 'Take those out of the game and we're in a far better position at half-time. 'It's great to have Matt Giteau coming back: having guys of that experience to come back into the 10-12 area is going to be invaluable. Matt Giteau breaks with the ball but is tackled by Andy Goode at the Felix Mayol Stadium . 'Michalak played well but you can't underestimate what a difference it makes to have another guy in there to organise the team and give us another voice on the field. 'Having him back especially is going to make a big difference for us. 'Obviously it would be fantastic to go out on a high, Jonny (Wilkinson) was able to do that last year when we won the double and he fully deserved it. 'But like I said, there's a fair bit of work in front of us before we start thinking too much about any of that.'","'It's great to get through of course, and winning is what counts ultimately, but there were far too many mistakes.'

England quick James Anderson plays his 100th Test match in Antigua against the West Indies from Monday . Anderson needs just three wickets to go level with Sir Ian Botham as England's top Test wicket taker . MICHAEL BROWN . Burnley CC team-mate, now club chairman . We used to call Jimmy the ‘Pro Killer’. Playing in the Lancashire League, he’d regularly get the opposition professional out. He was quite a slight kid. It was probably when he was 17 that we thought, wow, he’s got some pace. And he had this ability to bowl jaffas. When he bowled so brilliantly against Pakistan in the 2003 World Cup everyone at Burnley was saying: ‘We’ve seen these magic balls before.’ Anderson was known as Pro Killer during his days with Burnley, reveals former team-mate and now club chairman Michael Brown . My mum can take some of the credit for Jimmy being signed by Lancashire. He was bowling really well for Burnley, and she rang up John Stanworth, who was at the club at the time. Jimmy was invited for trials by Lancashire and that was that. He was always a shy lad. But he cares very much. JOHN STANWORTH . Former Lancashire player development manager . His potential was brought to my attention by Val Brown so I’m not going to take credit for unearthing Jimmy. I didn’t necessarily think he’d be the bowler he is today but there was just something about him. When he arrived for Under 17 nets he was a shy introvert but with the ability to bowl at good pace. But it was the late swing that stood out. Even established batsmen struggled to line him up. They were playing and missing all the time. He made them look ordinary. In the early days I just left him alone. He had these unusual mannerisms, like not looking at the batsman at the point of delivery, and a strange rotation of the shoulders. But I ignored all that even when coaches at other counties were pointing it out. I just said: ‘We’ve got a 17-year-old bowling 80mph and getting the top three out!’ WARREN HEGG . Anderson’s first captain at Lancashire and wicketkeeper . He burst on to the scene in my first year as captain. There was talk of this kid from the valleys in Lancashire. He wouldn’t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light with the funniest action. He bowled to me in a centre net practice at Old Trafford and was either turning me inside out or hitting me on the shin. I thought: ‘Either I’m losing it or this kid’s special’. And he really was. We sat down with coach Mike Watkinson and tried to work out how to set fields that were both attacking and defensive at the same time in case he sent down the odd poor ball. So we’d have three slips, a gully and a deep point. It gave him confidence to concentrate on how to be a fast bowler. ______ That said, he was partly responsible for ending my career a few games early. He bowled James Middlebrook down at Chelmsford and I dislocated a thumb after the ball ricocheted off the bails. But I could console myself with the thought that I’d kept to England’s best. MIKE WATKINSON . Anderson’s first coach at Lancashire . I was coaching the Lancashire second team when Jimmy arrived. He had wicked pace back then - probably even more than he has now - but he could be a little inconsistent. Some would swing, others wouldn’t. I’d been a swing bowler myself before changing to spin and I did some work with him before one game at Middleton. I tried to convey to him the importance of the relationship between the ball and the fingertips. He related to it straight away. Since then, he’s worked things out for himself. Jimmy’s been his own best coach. IAN WARD . Anderson’s first first-class victim: Lancashire v Surrey, Old Trafford, May 31, 2002 . He was then as he is now - as lithe as a whippet. His run-up was the same. I just remember him being quality. He had this very fast arm which was difficult to pick up at first. To me, a left-hander, it was an awayswinger. I remember getting one that was too good for me and edged it to Warren Hegg. Sky Sports commentator Ian Ward (left with Shane Warne) was Jimmy's first first-class victim . I thought ‘Christ, this guy can bowl!’ In those days Lancashire had Peter Martin and Glen Chapple and we weren’t expecting them to go on forever. We thought, they’ve found another one already. That was the talk in the Surrey dressing-room. And when he got Ramps in the second innings you could see he had something different. MARK RAMPRAKASH . Dismissed first ball in the second innings of the above match . I faced his first couple of balls in the first innings and they were wide of off stump. But they went through noticeably quickly and hit the keeper’s gloves quite hard. He was swinging it and getting it through at a good lick. Mark Ramprakash, now England batting coach, was dismissed LBW with the first ball of the second innings . In the second innings he gave me a straight one first ball. It was fast and swinging in and it hit me plumb in front. I was beaten for pace and a little bit of inswing, or maybe reverse. It was a terrific delivery. You tend to remember when a young man comes in and does that straight away. It raised a few eyebrows. At the Old Trafford Test against India last summer I was sitting on the team balcony as batting coach and I couldn’t remember a better exhibition of swing bowling. To witness that live was amazing. NASSER HUSSAIN . Anderson’s first England captain, in 2002-03 . He came into the team after yet another Ashes disaster. He was a breath of fresh air, a natural talent - very un-English! He wasn’t over-coached or too technical. He just ran in and bowled swing. He was the kind of player you might get from Pakistan. Anderson and his first England captain Nasser Hussain celebrate a wicket during the 2003 World Cup . For such a young lad, he wasn’t someone you needed to over-manage or look after. He was incredibly quiet but he knew exactly what he wanted to do. If anything I probably had such a good impression of him that I gave him more responsibility than I should have done - like bowling him instead of Andrew Caddick at the end of our World Cup game against Australia at Port Elizabeth in 2003. He got hit for six and I apologised to him later. He was playing pool, shrugged his shoulders, and got on with his game. But I knew he was going to be one of our greats. It’s one thing being a swing bowler but it’s the way he could get it to go so late. I faced him just once and he got me first ball at Old Trafford as part of a hat-trick. He’s a very clever cricketer. MARK BUTCHER . Man of the match on Anderson’s Test debut against Zimbabwe at Lord’s in 2003 . Anderson celebrates the wicket of Zimbabwe's Travis Friend with Michael Vaughan (right) and Robert Key (left) during his debut Test at Lord's in May 2003, in which Mark Butcher claimed five wickets and man of the match . Like Jimmy, I took five wickets in that game. I like to think I taught him everything he knows about swing bowling. This was the first time I’d seen him close up. He swung it both ways and at serious pace. I thought, we’ve found one here. I took a catch off him. Andy Bignaut was trying to work one through square-leg but he nicked it to slip. It was a cracking delivery. It’s an easy thing to do when you’re new to get your bouncer through quickly, then send down something a bit floaty when you bowl a fuller length. But his full balls were coming out at a good pace too. He was brilliant.","He went from strength to strength. Anderson (back row second from left) 'wouldn’t say boo to a goose but bowled like the speed of light,' says his 2002 Lancashire captain Warren Hegg (front row fifth from left) He was a keeper’s dream. He was in the high-80s and took the ball away so I always thought I was going to get a nick.","Based on the passages given, I'm unable to complete the described football sentences without making potentially incorrect assumptions about the sports.

Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. ______ Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.",The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015.,What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season.,0.8288269043,0.853310585,0.8408905864,0.1379310345,0.0,0.0689655172,0.0689655172

It is the fourth time this year that a late goal has cost the ninth-placed Hammers after draws at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and the defeat at Leicester City last week. Without the late goals they could be above Swansea City and sitting on a club-record 50 points. 'We can't find the right key elements to see that game out. We leave ourselves on a nervous edge,' Allardyce said. 'We are very nervous at that stage over what's happened before and we should be on 50 points now. We've thrown away seven points in two minutes or less in four games. 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but it finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' West Ham's performances have dipped since a strong start to the season but there was no sign of any supposed complacency early on against Stoke, and the reawakening coincided with the return of Enner Valencia. It was Stoke's inability to deal with him led to the opening goal after seven minutes. Glenn Whelan tripped Valencia five yards outside the penalty area to give West Ham an opportunity to shoot from the dead ball. Mark Noble looked the most likely candidate and when he stepped over the ball it seemed to leave goalkeeper Asmir Begovic confused. Instead, unlikely scorer Cresswell was the chosen one and he sent the free-kick over the wall and curling into the Bosnian stopper's top left-hand corner to give West Ham the lead with his second goal of the season.

Valencia's influence waned and instead it was Arnautovic who took control, dominating Cresswell down West Ham's left-hand side. Charlie Adam curled an ambitious free-kick over the bar from 40 yards out in search of his second wonder goal in a week before Jonathan Walters silenced an impatient Upton Park with a low strike that looked to have gone in but had instead hit Adrian's side netting. Victor Moses also had an opportunity, bringing down Arnautovic's cross inside the penalty area, spinning and firing in a shot that was deflected just wide. Allardyce would have been pleased just to see his side make it through to half-time unscathed and Stoke went in at the break with a sense of injustice after hearing referee Roger East blow his whistle as they prepared for the latest in a series of dangerous corners. A low-key opening to the second half allowed the home side to settle a bit and they looked the better side until a mistake by Winston Reid gave Adam a chance on the hour mark but a bobble came to the rescue and the Scot shot wide.

Johnson started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the course’s scoreable par fives to devastating effect. He had eagles at the second and the 8th, birdied the 13th, before striking a wondrous blow to the 15th that pulled up 12 inches from the flag. The difference between him and Spieth is he makes far more errors and one at the last meant he had to settle for a 67. Johnson will start the third round seven behind his fellow American with game chorus line member Charley Hoffman two strokes nearer the lead following a creditable 68. Gutsy Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey are on the same mark as Johnson, with the former weighing in with a fine recovery of his own. Rose was three over par after four holes but rallied strongly after drawing a line on his scorecard, like you’d draw a line in the sand. He played the last 14 holes in a plucky five under for a 70, while Casey underlined he is a man reborn with a terrific bogey-free 68.

It’s the sixth year in a row the Northern Irishman has thrown in a horrific nine like this and until he addresses the problem, he simply cannot win a green jacket. At least on the back nine he showed the pride of a current double major champion and the improvement he has made mentally from the days when his shoulders used to slump. One shot outside the projected halfway cut mark, he birdied the 10th and then, at the 13th, the hole that has given him so much trouble in the past, he hit his second shot to 3ft for a tap-in eagle three. McIlroy missed from 3ft at the 14th for a par but, in a rousing finish, birdied the 15th, 17th and the 18th. To the accompaniment of loud rumbles of thunder in the distance, McIlroy came home in just 31 shots to stand alongside Woods on two under.

Ben Hogan won three major championships in succession in 1953 and probably would have won the fourth as well but for the fact The Open clashed that year with the USPGA. Now here comes Spieth, who to this point has turned this Masters into his very own ‘hello, world’ moment with an awesome demonstration of dominance the like of which we haven’t seen since another 21-year-old named Tiger walked away with the 1997 edition. All this on the day another Lone Star legend, Ben Crenshaw, waved goodbye to the Masters. It’s tempting to talk about a passing of the Texas torch, except Spieth is destined for a level of greatness twice Masters champion Crenshaw could only dream about. Think Hogan rather than Gentle Ben. Rory McIlroy reacts to a poor second shot on the fifth hole in what was a frustrating day for the World No 1 . Paul Casey tries to clear out of a bunker on the eighth hole . As for Tiger, his first round 73 was actually an awful lot better than his score and the reviews suggested. It was, in fact, the most encouraging signs we’ve seen for him for well over a year. His short game was back to its best and his task on Friday was to instil some rhythm in his long game. That is exactly what happened. The rare sight of him finding the first fairway was encouraging and even better was the laser iron that followed. It finished 10ft away and the birdie putt found the middle of the hole. For 15 minutes, it was like watching Tiger at his best. The rest of the round was also heartening. He reached the turn in 34 to be one under for the event and inside the top 20. Justin Rose flips his club into the air after the English golfer cleared a sand trap on the 13th green . Ben Crenshaw closed out his Masters career with two mediocre rounds at Augusta . A birdie at the 11th and he was on the fringes of the top ten. How he does over the final two rounds is one more fascinating question during a weekend featuring many. Els was trying to build on the small miracle of his opening 67. The South African finished eighth on his Augusta National debut in 1994. Two months later, at the age of 25, he claimed the United States Open. Everyone looked at his languid grace off the tee and gossamer touch around the greens and wondered how many green jackets he would win. Twenty years on, he’s still waiting for his first. But he’s still in there trying. Depending on your viewpoint, his 72 leaves him perfectly placed to take advantage if Spieth feels the pressure over the weekend; or well in the mix to notch his third runner-up finish at the Masters. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68 just one shot ahead of Els .","Following one stunning round with another happens about as often at Augusta National as pieces of litter drifting across the property. Here, the youngest first-round leader in Masters history followed his 64 with a 66 to set a new 36-hole record total of 14 under par, beating the old mark of 13 under set by Ray Floyd way back in 1976. It also tied the lowest 36-hole total seen in a major, set by three others, including Sir Nick Faldo at The Open.","The blank should be filled with ""fox"".",0.8182346821,0.767855525,0.7922449708,0.0430107527,0.0,0.0430107527,0.0430107527

Rosberg accused Mercedes team-mate Hamilton of deliberately compromising his race at last weekend’s Chinese Grand Prix by slowing down but Mika Hakkinen said the British driver’s tactics, which saw him win a third consecutive Grand Prix ahead of the German, were entirely legitimate. ‘If you are leading a race that's a fantastic place to be and what goes in your mind when you are leading into finish the race first,’ said Hakkinen. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team, but Nico Rosberg appears less pleased with 2nd . Rosberg accused Hamilton of being selfish by driving too slow and compromising his second position . Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . ‘So you do everything with the team in the right way so you are able to finish the race first. If you have to save tyres, brakes, engine, gearbox whatever it is, that's what you do. 'You don't think about the guy behind you, what he is feeling, how his car is handling or how you want his car to handle at the end of the race you just take care of your own stuff. ‘I have been in this situation with Michael [Schumacher] where where I was much quicker than him and he was definitely challenging me in a very interesting way,’ added Hakkinen. ‘What Lewis and Nico are going through at the moment, they are having a very difficult challenge, already last year and there are challenges continuing this year between them. Rosberg responded to a fan who accused him of 'crying' after he complained about Hamilton . Former world champion Mika Hakkinen says Hamilton was well within his rights to look after himself . Hamilton celebrates with with his trophy and bottle of champagne after his race win . 'They are the drivers with the best possible chance of winning at the moment. It requires a lot of nerves from the drivers to be able to be a good racing driver and not to start fighting because it doesn't make any difference.’ Hamilton, who is bidding to win a third World Championship title this season, has out-qualified and out-raced Rosberg in all three grand prix and Rosberg will likely be feeling the pressure according to Hakkinen. ‘Nico has definitely got big pressure on him,’ said Hakkinen, ‘He doesn't know how it feels to be a world champion and doesn't know what confidence a world championship generates inside you when you are racing driver. ‘He is still hunting that feeling. He wants to win but first he has to beat Lewis but Nico is a great driver and if you look at the qualifying result at the last grand prix the time difference was hardly nothing. I don't say that pole position is the key point to win a grand prix certainly it helps to start in pole.’ Lewis, many congratulations. Was the race as expected in terms of the challenge from Ferrari and, also, can you talk us through that radio message you got from the team about speeding up? Were you aware that Nico was getting so backed-up towards Sebastian Vettel? LH: I wasn’t controlling his race, I was controlling my own race but, great race, I’m really happy. Definitely going into the race we thought it would be a lot closer and we knew the Ferraris were very, very good with their long run pace and also looking after their tyres. So, today the real goal was to manage the tyres. And, as I said, my goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico through the whole race. So, I just managed it and got to really enjoy it, to be honest. A few of the real good fun laps were the laps before the pitstop, which I really enjoyed. Ultimately it was a much smoother weekend than we had in the last race where we got the whole, full practice sessions, on my side of the garage at least. And it made a real big difference to the balance of the car for the race. So really happy, and yeah, kinda excited. Q: Nico, can you talk us through your view of the race today. ______ Driving slower than was maybe necessary at the beginning of stints meant that Sebastian was very close to me and that opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me. And then I had to cover him. So, first of all it was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time as a result because I had to cover him and then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer. So I’m unhappy about that, of course, today. Other than that, not much to say. Q: Lewis, would you like to respond? LH: Not really! My job is not to… it’s not my job to look after Nico’s race. My job’s to manage the car and bring the car home as healthy and as fast as possible – and that’s what I did. I didn’t do anything intentionally to slow any of the cars up. I just was focussing on myself. If Nico wanted to get by he could have tried but he didn’t.","Started second, finished second but you sounded at times as though you felt at times under a little bit of unnecessary pressure maybe? NR: No. It’s just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race.",That's an extensive conversation wasn't joined...(Sorry for the actual ongoing podcast episode cuts off),0.8077839613,0.7931559086,0.8004031181,0.0845070423,0.0,0.0563380282,0.0563380282

The Foxes had look buried two weeks ago, seven points adrift of the relative safety of 17th place, but are now just three points behind Hull City, the side immediately above the relegation trapdoor.

Leicester have been rooted to the foot of the table since November but are slowly building much-needed momentum as the battle to avoid the drop intensifies. 'I hope (we've got momentum). Back-to-back wins are difficult to achieve, especially for a side like ourselves who have been struggling for vast parts of the season in terms of results,' he said.

The king is dead; long live the king. Long to reign over us. Or should that be rain over us? The heavy downpours that drenched Augusta on Tuesday would have been greeted by groans from soaked patrons and photographers hoping for snaps of glamourous WAGs. But Northern Ireland’s world No 1 would be forgiven if he had grinned from ear to ear. That’s because each of McIlroy’s four major victories so far has come on courses which have been subjected to heavy rain at some point during the week. Wet conditions hand McIlroy a massive advantage: his huge hitting with sky-high ball flight means he can still fly his ball miles. Shorter hitters or those with low ball flight, meanwhile, will have no roll on the wet fairways and will be hitting their approach shots from miles back. Rory McIlroy shields himself from the rain on Tuesday - but a wet course will play into his hands . Augusta National looks at its finest in the sun, but the world No 1 has won all of his four majors after rain . And that is no good at Augusta, where precise approaches are vital to the most strategically demanding greens in major championship golf. Last year’s trio of Fred Couples (66-1 for 20th), Miguel Angel Jimenez (150-1 for 4th) and Bernhard Langer (400-1 for 8th) will be tough to match that this time round, but here goes… . Patrick Reed (40-1) – Brash, proud of it and born to show off on the biggest stage. Only his second Masters but played Augusta National many times as a college student. Tiger Woods (45-1) – OK, so no-one knows which Woods will turn up, but this could be one of the all-time cheeky punts. Practice form and rededication to the game are promising signs. Paul Casey (70-1) – Back to near his best after finally getting fully fit and committing to play full time in the US. Fifth-best on the PGA Tour in par-five scoring – crucial at Augusta. Since the work done to ‘Tiger-proof’ the course in the noughties, the home of the year’s first major has become a bomber’s course. ______ If that happens, the number of players who can win reduces dramatically. Three-time champion Phil Mickelson (28-1) and England’s former US Open winner Justin Rose (45-1) are tempting at their prices, but neither have hit their top form this year, so would be backed based on gut feeling rather than cold hard facts. The likes of Jordan Spieth (10-1), Zach Johnson (100-1), Ian Poulter (80-1) and Jamie Donaldson (125-1) have the brains and skill sets to get the job done. Woods (45-1) must be included in that group too, despite having no form, providing the chipping yips do not strike again. But they will all have to be at the very top of their games for the entire week to compete with the boom-boom brigade. Bubba Watson's power has taken him to two Masters victories, but his last title defence ended badly . Tiger Woods has the skill set to succeed for a fourth time at Augusta, but he must answer big questions . McIlroy (6-1) heads that pack, closely followed by Watson (11-1). Australia’s Jason Day (14-1) and Adam Scott (20-1), and Sweden’s Henrik Stenson (22-1) are joined by American gunslingers Dustin Johnson (16-1) and Jimmy Walker (22-1) as the big hitters who have shown best form so far this year. The Masters, played on the modern-day Augusta, is the one major of the year where a formula for a winner can be identified: long driving + strong early season form + course experience + the week of their lives = green jacket. Brooks Koepka (5-1) – it’s always tough to know how a player with no experience of Augusta will take to the place, but this monster-hitter looks to have the perfect game. The 24-year-old American globetrotter has won the Phoenix Open to the Turkish Airlines Open in the last six months. Scott, the 2011 champion, has made a late switch back to his long putter, which does not bode well. Stenson has been battling the flu, which either rules him out or makes him more dangerous, depending on whether you believe the old adage: ‘beware the wounded golfer’. But what makes Day, Johnson and Walker so appealing is that each has claimed at least one big win already this year on courses that favour big hitters.

The club are not guaranteeing the manager will survive but it does not appear they have already made up their mind to sack him as they did two seasons ago with Mancini. Their strategy was always to allow Pellegrini to continue until the end of his three-year contract in 2016 and then try and lure Pep Guardiola from Bayern Munich, whose own deal will be coming to an end in Germany.

You must say what you think about what happened and the solution. All the other things are a matter of trust.' Pellegrini also did his best to lend his support for Toure who has fallen short of his own standards this season and is being courted by Mancini at Inter Milan. Defending his player, the City boss said: 'I feel sorry for Yaya.

England's exiled record run-scorer made 170 off 149 balls against MCC Universities Oxford at The Parks on Sunday, at the start of Surrey's three-day fixture. Former England captains Alec Stewart, Pietersen's boss as Surrey director of cricket, and Nasser Hussain have since both had their say on the 34-year-old's chances of a return to the Test arena. Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey on day two of the three-day match against Oxford MCCU . Pietersen (centre) pictured with his Surrey team-mates at The Parks on Monday . Stewart is hoping Pietersen can further his quest when Surrey face Glamorgan in their first LV= County Championship fixture next week - while Hussain insists England's selectors need to clarify with a 'very public decision' once and for all whether the controversial South Africa-born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again. Pietersen's impressive return to long-form cricket 14 months after his England sacking was timely, on the eve of the first Test against the West Indies which began 4,000 miles away in Antigua on Monday. Stewart said: 'Anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors. 'Kevin shouldn't look any further than the next innings, whether it's here or down at Cardiff. 'If he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds, double-hundreds, help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to.

Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors . Hussain is impressed that Pietersen has already proved he is serious about a recall, and he is adamant the England and Wales Cricket Board must 'watch out' for him. 'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.' Hussain senses Pietersen will not be easily deterred, unless England spell out that they do not want him. 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. 'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.' Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday . ______ 'We've signed Kevin because he's a top-class player. 'Will he play for England? We don't know.

Lukaku was absent injured as Phil Jagielka’s goal settled this match to give Everton a third straight victory. But the win came in the wake of Lukaku’s new agent Mino Raiola saying Lukaku would never have signed for Everton had he been his representative earlier. ‘Later on, he’ll play for one of world’s best teams: PSG, Manchester City, Manchester United or Bayern Munich,’ Raiola said, sparking uncertainty over the future of the 21-year-old Belgian, who became Everton’s record signing when moving from Chelsea for £28million last summer. Romelu Lukaku (left) has had some big claims made about him by his new agent Mino Raiola (right) Roberto Martinez has dismissed claims suggesting his star striker could leave Goodison Park . Southampton have scored just five goals in nine games since the start of February (0.55 per game). ______ ‘Without a doubt we have been the best club for him because he has had his two best seasons that he has had as a professional and we love Romelu. Agent Raiola said he would have never sanctioned Lukaku’s £28million move to Goodison Park . Raiola hinted that Everton are just a stepping stone for Lukaku on his route to the very top . ‘It has been a joy to see him developing, there is going to be a lot of talk when you score goals as a striker, you are going to get the attraction of other teams … If an agent is going to make those comments, then it is normal that you are going to ask about it. An agent can say whatever they want and it is down to everyone else to see what is behind it.’ Martinez’s counterpart, Ronald Koeman, admitted Saints’s chances of Champions League football next season were all but extinguished by this defeat. ‘It’s not realistic [now] to finish in the top four,’ he said.’","This is less than a third the rate before that (1.68 per game). ‘In the modern game you don’t get the values of 25 years ago,’ said Martinez, implying a decline in standards of behaviour by agents. ‘But when you have a player on a long-term contract there is nothing to discuss. That is straightforward and clear.’ Lukaku signed a five-year contract at Goodison so will have four years remaining after this summer. ‘My focus is that Rom keeps on developing,’ Martinez said.","The correct sentence should be:

Sportsmail's Oliver Todd rated the player's performances at Ewood Park. BLACKBURN ROVERS: (4-4-2) Eastwood 7 . Could do nothing to stop Philippe Coutinho's winner but did well to deny Brazilian in the first half and even had a pop at goal himself with a brilliant turn in stoppage time.

Solid at right back, he kept Raheem Sterling quieter than most full backs in the Barclays Premier League would. Restricted in going forward as he kept an eye on England star. Baptiste 8 . ______ Another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge he faced from Daniel Sturridge and mainly restricted the England striker to potshots from range. Matt Kilgallon was another solid performer, the skipper was unfazed by the challenge of Daniel Sturridge . Olsson 7 . Could have gone down when under pressure inside the Liverpool area but his honesty was his own enemy. Solid at the back. Conway 6.5 .

Corry Evans is no stranger to a challenge, and he put himself about in midfield, replacing Jay Spearing . Evans 6.5 . No stranger to a challenge, put himself about in midfield after replacing cup-tied Jay Spearing. Booked for desperate challenge on Sterling. Williamson 7 . Tracked back really well and did his best to neutralise the threat of Coutinho. Could have given away a penalty in stoppage time for challenge on Joe Allen but referee made right decision. Marshall 7 . Creative force. Provided the ammo for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede as they looked to take advantage of an unfamiliar back-line. Unlucky to be denied by Simon Mignolet. Ben Marshall was unlucky to be denied when his header was saved by Simon Mignolet in the second half . Cairney 6.5 . Anonymous at times but then tested Mignolet from range as Rovers grew into the game early in the second half. Rhodes 6.5 . Subdued upfront and looked a poor replacement for Gestede who had impressed at Anfield. Missed with key header in the first half. Subs . Gestede 6.5 (for Conway 64) Came on to energise Blackburn as Liverpool took control but aside from one chance he showed a lack of match fitness, struggling with a hamstring problem.

LIVERPOOL: (4-2-3-1) Mignolet 7.5 . Recovered well from his Emirates horror show. Save from Marshall on to the post in key moment. Simon Mignolet recovered well from his Emirates horror show. Saved from Marshall in key moment . Johnson 6 . Played on the right of a back four. Natural role for him and found chances to go forward but left gaps at times. Sakho 5.5 . Struggled from the start, looking uncomfortable on the ball and he picked up a hamstring problem. Substituted after losing out to Rhodes. Lovren 6.5 . Good return to the side, albeit against lower league opposition. Team selection on Saturday indicated he was fifth choice but Anfield career not necessarily over. Moreno 6 . Comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do. Alberto Moreno had a comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do . Lucas 6 . Provided a solid base in midfield and moved the ball around well but not much penetration as Liverpool toiled in first half. Allen 5.5 . Similar to Lucas, couldn't provide impetus where it was needed, though. May have handled in own area and later appeared to go down easily for late penalty shout. Coutinho 8 .

Philippe Coutinho was the star man in Liverpool's midfield again, and his goal sends them to Wembley . Henderson 6.5 . His one-two with Coutinho set up the winner but his deliveries from dead-balls left much to be required at times. Sterling 6.5 . One of Liverpool's main threats as usual, playing down the left at Ewood Park. Impact blunted as Blackburn doubled up. Booked. Sturridge 5 . He's not back at his best yet and it showed. Seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times and was restricted to shots from distance. Daniel Sturridge is not back at his best yet and it showed. He seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times . Subs . Toure 7.5 (for Sakho 26) Solid in defence with Lovren, he ably deputised when Liverpool had to reshuffle early on and dealt with Gestede and Rhodes. Lambert (for Sturridge 85) No time. Headed first touch wide. REFEREE: . Kevin Friend 7 . Did all that could be expected of him. Missed Allen handball shout after Ben Marshall's header but that would have been harsh. Ignored penalty shout from same player in stoppage time. MAN OF THE MATCH: . Philippe Coutinho . A mercurial performance topped off with an excellent goal to decide the game.

Cooler overnight temperatures and low winds allowed fire crews to attack the blaze, increasing containment from 15 per cent, though on-the-ground conditions did not make that fight easy. The fire burned in the Prado Dam Flood Control Basin, where vegetation has not burned in decades, according to Capt. Mike Mohler of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. As a result, the area that is burning has up to 3 feet of 'duff' - needles, leaves and other combustible plant debris.

Liverpool offered Ibe fresh terms in February after he had a deep impression in a sequence of games, particularly against Everton and Tottenham, that coincided with an improvement in the club’s fortunes. A deal has now been agreed and it is simply a case of the highly-regarded Ibe, who has been absent since damaging knee ligaments against Besiktas on February 26, putting pen to paper. Jordon Ibe in training for Liverpool at Melwood as he prepares to make a return from injury . Ibe is set to sign a new long-term deal at Liverpool after breaking into the first team this season . Rodgers says Ibe, 19, has looked ‘absolutely sensational’ after stepping up his rehabilitation work in the last couple of weeks and he could come straight back into the starting line-up against Newcastle on Monday night. The issue Rodgers must address is whether to stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used at Blackburn in the FA Cup last Wednesday or revert to the 3-4-3 system that had been the catalyst for an improvement in results. One thing Liverpool’s manager has conceded, though, is that Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to recapture his very best form this season, given all the injuries he has suffered. Ibe, pictured in action against Tottenham, damaged his knee ligaments while playing against Besiktas . Sturridge, who has only scored four goals in his last 15 games, admitted last week that he felt it would have to wait until the new campaign to show last year’s sparkle and his manager agrees, following 12 months in which he has suffered thigh, calf and hip issues. ‘It’s a long time out,’ said Rodgers. ‘When you’re out for that length of time it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. ______ He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well but this season has been difficult. ‘He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can but sometimes that isn’t all down to you — sometimes it’s about luck as well.’","‘The key for him was to get back and be fit but he needs a good pre-season under his belt, a total run at pre-season and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season. Until that point we have to maximise what we can get out of him.’ Brendan Rodgers prepares his Liverpool team for the visit of Newcastle to Anfield on Monday . Daniel Sturridge is yet to rediscover his best form since returning from a lengthy injury lay off . Rodgers added: ‘Every player is different.

PSG beat Ligue 1 bitter rivals Olympique de Marseille 3-2, thrashed St Etienne 4-1 in the French Cup semi-finals, and won the League Cup final 4-0 against Bastia on Saturday. Even if they will be without the suspended Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti and the injured David Luiz, PSG believe they are peaking. Paris Saint-Germain will be without the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti against Barcelona . 'Do I feel a new momentum? It's been the case for a while. We worked physically (during the winter break) and today, in money time, we're good,' said coach Laurent Blanc. 'We are gaining momentum while last year at the same time we were on the way down.' Both teams have been meeting regularly recently in the Champions League, with PSG beating Barca 3-2 at home in a Group F game this season before losing 3-1 at the Camp Nou.

Tim Sherwood and Chris Ramsey know each other inside out. They also know how their careers could be shaped by 90 minutes of football at Villa Park. From living 10 minutes apart in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, the pair will be 10 metres away from each other on a touchline in Birmingham, relishing the pressure. The careers of Tim Sherwood (above) and Chris Ramsey (below) could be shaped by 90 minutes on Tuesday . Ramsey's QPR go to the home of Sherwood's Villa for a match that could see them out of the bottom three . A match of this magnitude is what these two English coaches craved during years working together at Tottenham Hotspur, probably believing they would be united in battle. A quirky sequence of events has pitted them on opposite sides instead. Sherwood came close to the QPR job when Harry Redknapp resigned, but Paul Lambert was sacked in the same period and Aston Villa placed the call. Ramsey looked the unlikely choice at Loftus Road but guided QPR to their first away Premier League victory this season at Sunderland, earning the reins until the summer. A second win on the road at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday means QPR can go above Villa with three points on Tuesday night, plunging Sherwood’s team into the relegation zone. The reverse result would take Villa to the precipice of safety, leaving QPR with a fainter glimmer of hope. QPR come into the match with confidence after a convincing 4-1 victory over Villa's neighbours West Brom . Christian Benteke celebrates his goal in Villa's 3-1 defeat by Manchester United on Saturday . It is a sliding doors match, the kind to be looked back upon in months to come as the moment futures were directed, both for clubs and managers. Lose and suffer relegation? Sherwood’s position would come under considerable question, his trajectory as the bright thing of English coaching skewered. Ramsey would likely be shuffled back to a role behind the curtain. Win and survive? Reputation enhanced, the opportunity to lay foundations would be presented. Either way, this pair will share pints again, unpicking the evening when their top-flight statuses came under enormous scrutiny. Neither Sherwood nor Ramsey has been trying to underplay this match, even if one offered a little more bombast than the other. ‘I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,’ said Sherwood. ‘If I could hype up the pressure even more I would.’ ‘A win would be a fantastic boost for us because it would see us above the line,’ said Ramsey. ‘It would give the fans a lot of hope that we have a chance of staying up.’ Neighbours within 10 minutes and friends, Ramsey (centre) and Sherwood (right) know each other inside out . The pair worked together at Spurs with Les Ferdinand (second right), now QPR's director of football . Under the floodlights, this promises to be a thrilling night of action. Villa Park has already enjoyed that with back-to-back matches in darkness against West Brom. The second victory, in the FA Cup, sparked a pitch invasion. The atmosphere against QPR will be tense and frenetic again. Sherwood will live every moment on the sidelines, Ramsey will be more considered. There are likely to be some telling looks either direction. Both would be inclined to work with each other again. ‘He’s a good pal of mine and a very loyal friend, but it’s been put to one side,’ insisted Sherwood. ‘Considering we worked together for four-five years before, there is going to be some sort of strange feeling,’ said Ramsey. Once the whistle blows it is down to the players, of course. QPR’s will bounce into action off the back of one of their finest performances this season. Villa underwhelmed in defeat at Old Trafford. The Hyatt hotel just off Broad Street brought comfort for Ramsey’s squad during their trip to the Second City three days ago, but Eduardo Vargas, scorer of two in two, will be missing through injury this time. Bobby Zamora, who claimed a wonderful strike at the Hawthorns, has been wrapped in cotton wool over the weekend. QPR will be without Eduardo Vargas, who scored his second in two games against West Brom .

High drama awaits. Christian Benteke . Struggled on return form Achilles injury and looked disinterested at times under Lambert, seems to have found his mojo for Sherwood as four goals in four games testifies.

Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. ______ Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances . When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side’s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit.

'One-nil to the Arsenal' used to be commonplace before Arsene Wenger arrived and made everything more exciting, and you sensed the class of 2015 quite enjoyed travelling north and nicking the narrowest of victories at Burnley with a first-half goal from Aaron Ramsey. It was Arsenal's eighth win in a row, their best run since the Invincibles team in 2004, and kept the pressure on Chelsea, who they meet in their next league game at the Emirates. Only once before this season have Arsenal won 1-0 but striker Olivier Giroud feels the hard-fought victory proved there is more to this current Wenger team than pass-pass-pass and dissolve when the going gets tough. In other words, they are built to last. Olivier Giroud wants Arsenal to continue their Premier League winning streak and challenge for the title . 'You can't play your best football every game. We tried to be focused on not conceding and it's one more clean sheet,' Giroud said proudly. 'As long as we were winning the game I don't think we were in too much danger. We are really pleased. 'If we had been told we would win this game 1-0 I would have signed for it straight away. Burnley played really tough against us. It was a big fight. 'We know about the record of the Invincibles. It's really good for us to be near that and I'm really proud to take part. But we don't want to stop here. We want to carry on and keep this good run going until the end.' Aaron Ramsey's 12th-minute strike was enough for Arsenal to earn a 1-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday . The win was Arsenal's eighth in a row and they kept up the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea . If Arsenal manage that, Jose Mourinho might have a far tighter finish to the title race than he could have anticipated a couple of months ago. Wenger has even found his own Claude Makelele in 23-year-old Frenchman Francis Coquelin who sat in front of the back-four and kept Burnley's chances to a minimum on Saturday. Club legend Thierry Henry even gave him a new nickname 'The Detective' for the way he sensed danger and snuffed it out. 'I always knew I could do a job for the team. I just needed a chance to show it,' said Coquelin, who was sent loan to Charlton earlier this season. It's ironic that having preached the beautiful game for nearly two decades Wenger has finally found a couple of warriors in Laurent Koscielny and Coquelin that hark back to the Tony Adams era. Arsene Wenger's side face Chelsea in their next home game and have an FA Cup semi-final to look forward to . Even if they can't catch Chelsea this time they will fancy a proper tilt at the Premier League next season and by then they might be back-to-back FA Cup winners. They won the trophy last May and face Reading in another semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. 'We have a better balance in the team,' Wenger said. 'Coquelin contributes to that, Hector Bellerin has come into the team and big players like Koscielny, Giroud and (Mesut) Ozil were out for four months in the season. People forget that. 'I also have a quality bench and quality players like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mathieu Debuchy who didn't travel. We have a big squad and I think we have quality.' Francis Coquelin was praised for his performance in midfield with Thierry Henry calling him 'the detective' 360 - days since Arsenal's last 1-0 away win in the Premier League. That was in March 2014 against Tottenham when Tomas Rosicky scored the winner. The Arsenal manager is playing down chances of overtaking Chelsea: 'We have to be perfect' – but the Emirates will still be buzzing in a fortnight when the top two clash. For Burnley, it will be matches against Hull City, Leicester City and Aston Villa in the next five weeks that determine their Premier League survival prospects rather than this result.

So too, indirectly, for Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt. Lahm's tackle on a team-mate at Bayern Munich's training ground on the outskirts of the city appeared innocuous enough, until a scream of pain pierced the morning air and a frantic wave signalled he was in trouble. As players milled round him, and a physio inspected the damage, the call went out for expert medical help. There wasn't any. To the dismay of Pep Guardiola, there wasn't a single qualified doctor on site. Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt quit this week after a reported rift with Pep Guardiola . The pair fell out over an injury to Philipp Lahm during training as early as November last year . As Lahm lay on the turf with what was later diagnosed as a broken ankle, the physio tended to him as best he could, while an ambulance was summoned to take him to a local hospital. Muller-Wohlfahrt, meanwhile, was at his city centre clinic, nearly eight miles away. It was last November, and from that day on, the 72-year-old's days as head of Bayern's medical department were numbered. They finally ended after Bayern's Champions' League defeat at Porto, when Guardiola went public with his displeasure over recovery rates for injured players by blaming a lengthening injury list for his side's quarter-final first-leg demise. It was more than the world-renowned specialist could stomach, and he promptly walked away from the Bundesliga champions for a second time, taking the rest of his staff with him. He quit in high dudgeon once before, after a fall-out with Jurgen Klinsmann, but there will be no coming back this time. Not as long as Guardiola holds the reins. And that may just be for quite a while yet. The Bayern boss is aware Manchester City long to install him as replacement for Manuel Pellegrini, even if it means waiting another 12 months for his contract to expire, but the latest ructions at The Allianz Arena have evidently done nothing to increase their chances. ______ Dispiritingly for City, the former Barcelona manager reaffirmed, at his Friday press conference, that he will 'for sure' honour the remaining year on his contract, ruling out any hope of a deal being struck with Etihad bosses this summer. Beyond that, he could even commit himself to a further spell in charge, according to a Bayern insider, who told Sportsmail: 'There is no question that Bayern will do absolutely everything in their power to persuade Guardiola to sign another contract. 'There will be negotiations after the season is finished, and there is an air of confidence within the club that he will agree. It is far from certain, but, interestingly, the departure of Muller-Wohlfahrt makes it more probable, rather than less so. Muller-Wohlfahrt (fourth from left) sits behind Pep Guardiola during the defeat by Porto this week . Manchester City long to bring in Guardiola to replace Manuel Pellegrini but they may have to wait for him . 'That was a problem, because they had many disagreements over the treatment of injured players. Now he has gone, Guardiola is in a stronger position than ever. That is clear, because when Muller- Wohlfahrt said he was leaving, the club made no attempt to talk him out of it. They simply accepted it and said thanks very much. 'Pep has got his own way again, and that could play a part when they sit down in the summer to discuss a new deal.' So what went wrong between them? How could it be that a vastly- experienced and hugely-respected surgeon with a track record for rescuing stellar careers imperilled by injury failed to meet Guardiola's requirements as club doctor? Certainly, availability was a major issue. Sportsmail has learned that one of Guardiola's stipulations, after taking over from Jupp Heynckes, was that the club doctor should be at the training ground every single time the players were there. Dante, Sebastian Rode, Lahm and Robert Lewandowski (L-R) trudge off the pitch after defeat in Porto . Muller-Wohlfahrt has worked with the German national team as well as athletes including Usain Bolt . Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt has often courted controversy with his methods. He claims that a substance called Hyalart, which is extracted from the crest of cockerels, helps lubricate knee injuries and take away pain. He also swears by Actovegin, an amino acid preparation derived from calves' blood. In 2009, he prescribed more than 50 injections of goat's blood to St Johnstone striker Peter MacDonald for his hamstring injury. Among those to have been treated by him are Ronaldo, Usain Bolt, Michael Owen and Jose Maria Olazabal. Muller-Wohlfahrt claims to have administered more than one million injections, at least half of which have been to athletes. A stickler for detail, he wanted to ensure any mishap could be dealt with expertly at a moment's notice and made it clear it was an instruction to be adhered to by Muller-Wohlfahrt. It placed club bosses in a quandary, not for the last time, as Muller-Wohlfahrt pointed out he had a steady stream of high-profile patients to his city centre practice, not least the likes of Usain Bolt, and that he could ill-afford to desert his post to spend day after day at the club's training facility. Irked by Muller-Wohlfahrt's defiance, it soon became apparent to Guardiola that they were diametrically opposed when it came to policy over ushering players back from injury. In a nutshell, Guardiola wanted players declared fit and pencilled in for selection as rapidly as possible, whereas care and caution were the key words for Muller-Wohlfahrt. It drove Guardiola to distraction, according to the club insider, who said: 'Pep has never been the most patient about players' recovery time. If there is an injury, he expects it to clear up. He wants the players back on the pitch, but it wasn't happening. 'Muller-Wohlfahrt is the opposite. He takes the view that you have to be patient and allow the healing process to take its course. He wants a player to be in perfect condition when he returns and argues that rushing people back runs the risk of a fresh injury. Really, it's no wonder they were at loggerheads.' Guardiola wanted players declared fit as rapidly as possible, but Muller-Wohlfahrt wanted care and caution . Muller-Wohlfahrt prescribed a course of action for a nagging injury to Thiago Alcantara but was overruled. As a further insight into the core differences between the pair, Muller-Wohlfahrt prescribed a specific course of action for a nagging injury to Thiago Alcantara but was overruled. The midfielder suffered damage to the same area of his knee three times in quick succession, and Muller-Wohlfahrt was adamant he should attend the veteran medic's clinic in Colorado for specialised treatment. Guardiola was having none of it and, instead, arranged for Thiago to undergo treatment in Barcelona, where, to Muller-Wohlfahrt's exasperation, surgery was followed by recuperation and an eventual return to the Bayern squad. Usain Bolt was one of many athletes to benefit from Muller-Wohlfahrt's treatment at the London Olympics . Guardiola is now in the strongest position he has ever been at Bayern and he could agree a new deal there . If protesting to the Bayern boss was futile, trying to appeal to Thiago was just as pointless. His agent is none other than Guardiola's brother, Pere. The odds were stacked ever-higher against Muller-Wohlfahrt, and his resignation on Friday morning was merely confirmation the Guardiola empire is not about to be overthrown. City must now wait to see if the Spaniard's Bavarian rule is about to be extended, as forecast with growing confidence in Munich circles.","Bayern  doctor Muller-Wohlfahrt is a world-renowned specialist and quit after Guardiola's injury complaints .

Jenna Louise Driscoll, 25, was due to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday on seven charges of supplying or trafficking drugs, one charge of unlawful wounding and three charges of bestiality with her dog. ______ Police were carrying out checks on Driscoll's phone for suspected drug trafficking when they discovered the three videos which allegedly show her having sex with a dog . Driscoll was due to appear at Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday but didn't show up and is now wanted by police on seven drug charges, one of unlawful wounding and three charges of bestiality with her dog . Following her court appearance last October, the 25-year-old was pictured arriving home  accompanied by an unidentified man and a pet dog. The dog,  believed to be a pitbull terrier, climbed the stairs to Driscoll's cream coloured residence, where neighbours say she has lived for some time. Driscoll entered her house and remained for a very short amount of time, before leaving with the man in the sedan. The charges laid against Driscoll came when police had earlier carried out checks on her phone for suspected drug trafficking and discovered the three videos. ‘This isn’t something you’d normally expect, it’s quite unusual. The last case I can recall was a few years ago, it certainly isn’t something we hear reported often,' said Mark Townend, CEO of RSPCA Queensland. ‘Under the Animal Care Protection Act bestiality isn’t included. To take action and remove the dog we would have to prove actions there were cruel or that it was tormented.’ ‘The RSPCA would ideally like to get a dog out of the situation if bestiality was happening, but to operate under the act we would have to prove those two things.’ ‘We’d try to do everything we can to help the dog if that is the case.’ Driscoll was also charged with two counts of possession of an item used in the commission of a crime and three counts of supplying. She was granted bail but will have to report to police once a week and live at an apartment at Enoggera, south-west of Brisbane. Police prosecutor Sergeant Scott Pearson said Driscoll had allegedly been dealing cannabis to friends. Text messages showed that Driscoll had arranged for 113 grams of the drug to be sold for $1,150 and on another occasion 85 grams for $900, according to Sgt Pearson. It was when police were investigating the text messages they located the videos of Driscoll allegedly having sex with the dog.

The Northern Ireland international finally joined up with his Ibrox team-mates this week, more than two months after he was one of five Newcastle players sent north on loan to the Championship side. Ferguson has not played since his country’s 2-0 European qualifier win over Greece in Athens in October and the 23-year-old’s knee injury had been expected to keep him out for the season. Rangers manager Stuart McCall takes a training session at Murray Park on Tuesday morning . But McCall revealed: ‘Shane’s been out for five months but the good thing about him is his mental state. I spoke to him on Monday and I was really impressed. Do I get the impression he is he is here to play? Yes, definitely. ‘I liked the way he was talking, he wants to get straight into it. He’s a naturally fit lad and he seems really focused too, so that was pleasing. ‘He trained really hard on Monday and on Tuesday and he’s on his way to a quick recovery, which would be positive news for us. ‘If our Under-20 game (against Dundee United on Tuesday) had not been on astro turf, he might have got an hour under his belt. ‘But if you’ve been out that long you’re going to need four to six weeks to get back on track. So he certainly won’t be ready in the next two weeks but hopefully he will play his part in the back end of the season.” Newcastle United loanee Shane Ferguson takes part in the training session . Rangers were controversially loaned players from Newcastle in January, when St James’ Park and Sports Direct supremo Mike Ashley was still calling the shots in the Ibrox boardroom ahead of the Dave King-led takeover. Then-manager Kenny McDowall sensationally revealed he had been ordered to play all five when fit. But with Rangers believed not to have carried out medicals, Kevin Mbabu and Ferguson have not featured through injury and fitness, while Gael Bigirimana is believed to have a blood disorder. Defender Remie Street went off injured after 44 minutes of his debut and has not been seen since, . Only Slovenian Haris Vuckic has been a success, scoring six goals in his last seven games. But McCall now hopes he can call on a player who impressed last summer in friendlies for Northern Ireland against Chile and Uruguay. ‘I’ve spoken to a couple of lads like Dean Shiels, who know Shane from Northern Ireland, and it’s all positive,’ said McCall. ‘I also spoke to Northern Ireland manager Michael O’Neill about him. He’s filled in at left-back for them but probably his best position is one up on the left. He’s certainly a good crosser of the ball, he’s shown that in the sessions we have done. Ferguson (right) finally joined up with the Rangers squad in Glasgow this week . ‘I went through his Wikipedia last night and I think he’s played 23 games for Newcastle in the Premier and 30 for Birmingham. You don’t play that number unless you’ve got something about you.’ Rangers must pay Newcastle an extra £500,000 over and above wages for the loan players if they go up through the play-offs but McCall would be delighted if that happens. ______ ‘But if we do get promoted, it would be seen as a successful season. I know that’s quite hard to comprehend but from where we were a couple of months ago, to actually get up would be good. ‘Winning the league would have been great but the aim was always to get promotion. And the way the season has panned out for us, it will now need to be through the play offs.’ Hibs and Rangers are currently locked on 61 points, with Wednesday's match at Livingston representing the Ibrox side’s game in hand. The Easter Road club have a better goal difference of +2 but McGregor is happy that Rangers remain in control of their destiny with Dumbarton away and Falkirk at Ibrox their remaining two matches after their visit to the Energy Assets Arena on Wednsday. Rangers players prepare for the trip to bottom-of-the-table Livingston on Wednesday night . ‘We know our goal difference is short at the moment, but we also know if we keep winning game it’s in our hands to finish second,’ said McGregor. ‘If we beat Livingston, we are three points clear. ‘We want to finish second because that would give us one week more preparation for the play-offs. So we want to win every game until the end of the season. ‘We’ve shown a glimmer of what we are capable of lately and we need to bottle that and take it to Livvy.’","‘It was a surprise to everyone when the news about that came out, because it’s quite a lot of money, especially when only one of the (loan players) is playing,’ said McCall. ‘But if it was me - and it’s not because it’s not my money - I’d love to give Newcastle £500,000 because that means we have got promotion.’ Defender Darren McGregor echoed his manager’s views and insisted that promotion was all that mattered after what has been a roller-coaster season.

Jeanetta Riley, 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014. The troubled Native American woman, who was addicted to meth and alcohol, had been taken to the hospital by her husband, 44-year-old Shane, following threats she made to kill herself, according to the Guardian. While parked outside of the emergency room of Bonner General Hospital, she pulled a knife from under the car seat featuring a three-and-a-half-inch blade, and was confronted by police before she was shot and killed. In the video, Jeanetta is heard in an exchange with officers as they repeatedly tell her to put the knife down but she refuses before a commotion is heard and they shoot her. Jeanetta Riley (pictured left with her husband Shane), 35, a mother-of-three daughters was killed last July after she brandished a knife at two cops outside of a hospital in Sandpoint on the evening of July 8, 2014 . She was taken to hospital by her husband, Shane, after he heard her fiddling with blades and talked about killing herself and stabbing people (Jeanetta pictured above with her daughters Dayna, top, Dolly, left, and Hannah, right) Officers Michael Valenzuela, 27 and Skyler Ziegler, 29 were cleared of any wrongdoing following the incident and the case was closed in November. In the footage, Valenzuela, Ziegler and a third officer, Garrett Johnson, 23 arrived at the scene where Jeanetta was sitting in the car holding the bottle of vodka and the knife. She then walked towards them with the knife at her side, according to the Guardian. In the footage, Ziegler is heard shouting 'walk over here' and 'show me your hands' before she responds 'f*** you. no.' She is told again to put down the knife and continues to refuse and shouts 'bring it on, no.' Jeanetta then steps off the curb and into the road towards the two officers when gun fired is heard, with three bullets striking her torso and one striking her heart. Jeanetta took the knife from under the car seat and was confronted by officers who repeatedly told her to put the knife down but she refused (above scenes from the incident) After she stepped off the curb and walked towards them, they fired their guns and she was killed (above the moment she was shot) The events leading to the incident unfolded when the couple, who was homeless and living out of a 1996 Chevrolet van parked next to a lake, had spent the day with Jeanetta's daughter, 13-year-old Hannah. Jeanetta and Shane had arguments earlier in the day that were escalating when she began mentioning harming herself. The pair dropped Hannah off at her stepfather's house, and after drinking half a bottle of vodka while back at their camp, Jeanetta spoke about killing herself and stabbing people, Shane said.

In November, the officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a local prosecutor. Fourteen hours after Jeanetta was shot and killed, a dog called Arfee was fatally shot by police in nearby Coeur d’Alene, in a killing that was ruled unjustified.

The French centre-back flung himself through the air to reach Xavi's free kick at the back post, heading home from close range, finally breaching Celta Vigo's stern defence. It was Mathieu who had opened the scoring in the El Clasico, in similar fashion. Pique, meanwhile, just a minute before Mathieu scored, had made an incredible, game-saving tackle on Celta striker Charles, to prevent him from opening the scoring.

This gritty, barely-deserved triumph helped Barcelona stay four points ahead of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga, after Ancelotti’s side's almost-harrowing 9-1 demolition of Granada . Celta Vigo’s aggressive pressing nearly paid dividends, but their hard-work and effort counted for nothing thanks to Mathieu’s goal. Their frustration manifested itself in a bizarre way, with Fabian Orellana sent off for throwing a lump of turf at Sergio Busquets. For some reason Sergio Alvarez, Celta Vigo's goalkeeper, is kryptonite for Barcelona's attacking trident, as they also failed to beat him in 90 minutes at the Camp Nou earlier this season. After Barcelona's Halloween nightmare against Celta Vigo, the directive from Luis Enrique here was not to leave with egg on their faces on Easter Sunday. Barcelona's own website stated that 'a dose of retribution' was in order, after the 1-0 defeat by Eduardo Berizzo’s side in late autumn. Before the game Spanish media wondered if the international break had happened at just the wrong time for Barcelona and just the right time for Real Madrid – something reflected in Madrid’s big win at lunchtime. The Frenchman wheels away in celebration of his second half header at the Balaidos Stadium . Gerard Pique (right) and Sergio Busquets join the French defender in celebration of his goal . With Los Blancos in disarray, a couple of weeks spent healing wounds away from the Santiago Bernabeu seemed an agreeable plan, while Barcelona's momentum was disrupted. Jordi Alba was injured playing for Spain, so Adriano Correia started in his stead. Messi, meanwhile, was dragged round the United States with Argentina, sidelined because of an inflamed foot which left him unable to put his boots on. He managed to do that here, but his presence was barely noticed on the pitch. With rival Cristiano Ronaldo scoring an incredible five goals earlier, Messi was left frustrated in his quest for the golden boot, with the Madrid man four strikes ahead of him on 36. Luis Enrique hasn't shown himself to be the sentimental type, but the former Celta Vigo manager gave Rafinha Alcantara a rare start against the team which he played for, both before moving to Barcelona at 13, and last season on loan. However, the midfielder failed to impress and made way for the legendary Xavi early in the second half. Mathieu (left) is congratulated by team-mates Lionel Messi and Neymar (right) after his goal . Javier Mascherano was suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards, as is his wont, but luckily for Barcelona Busquets was fit enough to start for the first time in over a month. ______ Profligacy was an issue in that 1-0 defeat too, which we were reminded of when Neymar slashed the rebound high and wide. Los Celestes had made the early running themselves and Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, who boasts the best defensive record in La Liga, was down quickly to deny Joaquin Larrivey at his near post. It was Larrivey that put the first goal of the season past Bravo at the Camp Nou and he was determined not to let the Celta forward in again. With Messi quiet, it was down to the other two prongs of Barcelona's trident to try and make inroads. Neither were successful. Fabian Orellana was shown a red card for throwing a chunk of grass in the direction of Sergio Busquets . The lump of turf strikes Busquets in the neck after tempers reached boiling point . Neymar antagonised the Celta Vigo fans as he drew several fouls, but the Barcelona ones too with his incredible wastefulness. To watch him in recent weeks is to see a different player to the one that dismantled La Liga defences earlier in the season. His first touch was frequently poor, his passes off-target. Suarez, meanwhile, went down in the box looking for a penalty under an arm from Gustavo Cabral, but far too little contact to actually tumble. He was then booked on the stroke of half-time for a dive, although this time he has been charged into. The one opportunity Suarez got he hit hard and true, stinging the palms of Alvarez. But Celta Vigo were on top and Nolito was getting the better of Dani Alves time and time again. Maybe the Brazilian's mind is elsewhere, with his contract expiring in the summer, but physically he seems less capable too. Orellana (right) leaves the field after referee Inaki Vicandi Garrido brandishes a red card . The Barcelona players surround referee following a controversial decision . One horrendous defensive mix-up left Nolito charging for the ball with Bravo. The keeper got his foot to it before colliding with the Celta Vigo man, but the fans screamed for a penalty, unsuccessfully. The offside flag being raised against Orellana led to a Celta goal being ruled out, but the best chance fell to Larrivey before the interval. Orellana cut the ball neatly across the box but the striker, unmarked, nine yards out, lacked composure, hacking at it and sending it into the Vigo night sky. Barcelona continued to struggle, with Neymar’s goal harshly ruled out for offside and a shanked Alves shot the only efforts to their credit. Messi and Neymar react after another missed opportunity during a frustrating evening for the duo . Then came Pique’s tackle on Charles, with the defender making a super-human effort to get back and deny the striker. Celta Vigo were almost instantly punished for it, with Mathieu breaking the deadlock. Barcelona couldn’t kill the game, even after Orellana’s late sending off, with Messi scooping the ball over Alvarez but inches over the crossbar too. It didn’t matter; they held on to earn the three points and maintain the four-point lead over Real Madrid that they started the week with. And one game less for each side to play. It’s not pretty, it’s not ‘the Barca way’, but if Enrique lifts La Liga, nobody will be worrying about that.

The reigning world champion won his second race in three to start the 2015 season, but his podium celebrations have drawn some criticism. A leading group which campaigns against sexism has condemned the behavior of the driver as 'selfish and inconsiderate', saying he should be forced to apologise for 'specially directing' the bubbly into the woman's face. Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Chinese Grand Prix by spraying a hostess in the face with champagne . The hostess looks less than impressed as she is sprayed with champagne on the podium in Shanghai . Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object, a campaign on media sexism and 'sex object culture', said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future. For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Hamilton's celebrations have led to criticism of the two-time world champion . Hamilton controlled the contest in Shanghai to seal his second victory in three races this season . Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'. ______ Another wrote: 'Have a bit more respect for the ladies please. Spraying Champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot.' Hamilton sprays a hostess after winning the Spanish Grand Prix in Catalunya last May . And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.' It is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move. He celebrated in a similar fashion after winning Spanish Grand Prix last year, which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the driver's standings. And although he lost the Austrian Grand Prix to teammate Nico Rosberg, he didn't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess. The 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on Graham Norton's talk show in 2013. But not everyone was offended by his behaviour. Many found his actions amusing, while another said: 'I can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @LewisHamilton.. Lighten up people!' Hamilton and his team-mate Nico Rosberg had a spat when the German said his team-mate slowed him down . Rosberg was unhappy as he felt that Hamilton backed him up into the reach of Sebastian Vettel .","Another user simply said: 'Man please stop spraying Champagne on the Podium Ladies.

Hitting Bradford City for six of the best in their own backyard saw them triumphantly over the finishing line, although given their free-wheeling and free-scoring form the result really came as little surprise. Aden Flint celebrates with a bottle of Sky Bet champagne following Bristol City's promotion . City players are sprayed with champagne after securing promotion from League One . And there’s more. Add to that their memorable Johnstone’s Paint Trophy victory at Wembley last month - when Walsall were comfortably beaten 2-0 in the final - and you have a truly historic campaign for Steve Cotterill’s team. The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday . Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade . ‘When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. ‘We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.’ That’s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style . City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne . They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. ‘Nobody wants that runners-up medal. The aim was always to go up as champions and we’re close to achieving that,’ Flint says. ‘We’ve had that winning habit and it’s a good one to get in to. We’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing.’ Seldom does one team dominate a division in this way. The lowest City have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture. The Robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy . Once again, Flint (right) made a huge contribution, giving City the lead against Walsall on March 22 .

Since September 13th, there has only been one week when they haven’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the New Year. Not that success has been reserved for the league. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: ‘I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.’ The defender’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he’s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: ‘I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest! Flint holds the JPT with pride as he celebrates the 2-0 victory against Walsall last month . The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March . ‘I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. ‘Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season. Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. ‘But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort.

This season, like so many in recent years, has been a frustrating one at St James' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday. A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley, which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east. ______ Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James' Park . It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out . The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood. 'We need to have patience, we need to work hard, we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season.' Pochettino will come up against his countryman Jonas Guiterrez following his recovery from cancer . This weekend's match against Newcastle will also see Pochettino come up against a countryman who has made many a headline of late. Former Argentina international Jonas Gutierrez's recovery following a battle with cancer and his return to top-flight football has inspired many. 'I am very happy for him,' Pochettino said. 'When he went in the game against Liverpool, he got a good ovation and it was good to see him playing football. 'This is real life. Sometimes we worry about a lot of things and results, but this is real life when you have the problems that he has.

202298,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,4215,0,3,"It is not a match to decide the title, as has been the case in earlier seasons. But the Manchester derby this Sunday still holds great significance for both clubs, managers and, of course, supporters. City have won the last four contests between the sides, as well as the previous three at Old Trafford. A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time. Here Sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers. Can Manuel Pellegrini survive a derby loss? The word is the Chilean’s future will be decided come May when the dust on a creaking season has settled. Defeat to cross-town rivals would push chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though. It would leave City trailing United by four points and likely to finish fourth, needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to Champions League – the very minimum requirement. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) is a man under-pressure at City and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable . Who needs the win more? To that end you would probably have to say City. A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation, and reignite ambitions to finish second, possible saving Pellegrini from the axe. United look set to finish in the top four regardless, the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory. But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours. United have never lost five in a row to City before. Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed. Glenn Murray (right) tormented City at Selhurst Park as they dropped out of the Premier League title race . Would victory dispel any lingering doubts about Louis Van Gaal? Quite likely. Three successive wins on the bounce against opposition the stature of Tottenham, Liverpool and City would underline Van Gaal’s ability to rise to the big matches and suggest that, after a season of trial, error, and turnstile selections, the plan is coming together. Those uncertainties around the Dutchman would resurface just as swiftly with defeat of course. Louis van Gaal has had his critics this season but Manchester United's performances are proving them wrong . Should Vincent Kompany remain in the City side? It would be a big call for a game of such size, but the sense that City may be better off without their captain cannot be disregarded. These should be the 29-year-old’s peak years but injuries seem to have affected his body and mind. The Belgian is increasingly prone to errors of judgement. Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala do not provide the most robust competition but Kompany’s appearance in seven losses in 12 games speaks volumes. Mangala, on the bench against Crystal Palace, has experienced three losses in 24 matches all season. Vincent Kompany (left) has struggled for form this campaign and could lose his place for the derby . Where does this rank in English football’s biggest games? Manchester has become a powerhouse of English football through City’s ascent. The city has been home to the Premier League title for the past four seasons, oscillating between Old Trafford and the Etihad. That will not be the case this year but the rivalry still burns and allied to the global scale of these clubs the match ranks as high as any other, perhaps only beaten by Liverpool-United. Mario Balotelli (centre) produced one of the most iconic derby moments when he scored at Old Trafford . Who is the better player right now: Wayne Rooney or Sergio Aguero? No doubt Aguero is the better striker, his movement, angles for shooting, and goal-scoring record stands testament to that. ______ At the moment you would have to go for Rooney. These two love the Manchester derby. Rooney holds the record for most all-time goals with 11, while Aguero has six in seven. Wayne Rooney (left) and Sergio Aguero are two of the best forwards in the current Premier League . How crucial might Michael Carrick be? His return to the United lineup in the fulcrum role in front of defence has lifted the side considerably. He has not enjoyed the best returns facing City in recent seasons – and in the corresponding fixture was asked to play centre-back as a first-half substitute – but will get more space in his deeper midfield role. It is unlikely Pellegrini will task anyone with marshalling Carrick, which is how he likes it. Michael Carrick (left) has become a key player for United over the years and is pivotal for Van Gaal . Will the real Yaya Toure show up? You would hope so. Yaya at the height of his powers in an awesome sight and could prove the difference. But those flashes have been all too fleeting this season. Now would be a good time to step up. Like Kompany, Yaya Toure's form is patchy but he scored a stunning goal against Crystal Palace on Monday . Will United solve the problem of Angel di Maria? The team looks balanced right now, with Ashley Young doing nothing to lose his place. United’s record signing has been coming on and providing assists, so Van Gaal is probably inclined to repeat the pattern. Ultimately, Di Maria must provide more, and will want to, but at this moment he should start on the bench. Why is kick-off at 4pm? Police saw no dangers of the late afternoon kick-off time on a Sunday, and have cited previous good behaviour between sets of supporters. As ever, television dictates the preference and the 4pm slot is prime for viewers. Angel di Maria hasn't quite settled in Manchester but recently has done well when coming off the bench .","But since being shifted to his preferred centre-forward role, Rooney is displaying form that would see him into any side. He has been approaching his all-action peak and scored seven goals in ten games for club and country, taking his overall season tally to 21. Aguero has 23 for the campaign, but has failed to find the net in his last six games, a run stretching back to February 24.","The blank is: _______________________ academy.

Once again they showed when they play their best they can beat everyone. I told them after the game if there is a team who deserve to be in Premier League it’s them. ‘The last game on May 2 we’ll see which team will get promotion but I think it’ ll go to the last second.’ Tettey’s mistake could prove costly in one of the most exciting end-of-season run-ins after it ended a run of eight games unbeaten for his side. Karanka admitted before the match that if his side lost they would have been cut too far adrift from the front runners, but all remains to play for now. The strong away contingent had settled easily in Norwich’s Riverside entertainment park ahead of kick-off and their team comfortably matched them on the pitch, in unfamiliar surroundings away from their Riverside Stadium, in the opening exchanges. Twenty minutes after the game had started and the home side had barely got out of their own half while Middlesbrough carved out chance after chance. One of those, in the ninth minute, produced the opener. Middlesbrough had lost back-to-back away matches - against promotion rivals Bournemouth and Watford - for the first time this season before the match, so their lead was a surprise. So, too, was the look on Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy’s face when Adam Clayton sent in a corner from the left and his own midfielder Tettey headed the ball at the near post over him and into the far right of goal. It had been coming. Four minutes in and full-back Tomas Kalas burst on the overlap down the right to cross for Jelle Vossen whose header was deflected wide. Two minutes later Albert Adomah, again on their right flank, feinted a cross and turned back on himself before playing the ball to Patrick Bamford. His flick-on found Vossen again and his half-volley arrowed towards the top right corner but went just over. ‘The first 15 minutes cost us the game,’ Norwich manager Alex Neil admitted. ______ It looks more likely that we are going to be involved in the play-offs so what we need to do now is dust ourselves off.’ Norwich midfielder Wes Hoolahan (left) tries to run past Boro's Adam Clayton during Friday's encounter .

The foray forward saw Bradley Johnson head a ball into the box back across goal and Jonny Howson had a free header six yards out but failed to find the target. It was, however, the catalyst for the home side to get a foothold in the game and their pressure mounted from then on until the final whistle went after seven minutes of stoppage time. A fierce intensity gripped proceedings with the home side unable to capitalise on their growing possession. The sold-out stadium roared their team on and they even threw Ruddy up at the end for a series of corners. It peaked in the final few moments when, from one of those corners, Middlesbrough defender Ben Gibson threw himself in front of Russell Martin’s volley to prevent what would have been a certain goal.

Macleod suffered a hamstring injury in his final game for Rangers at Alloa's Indodrill Stadium in December.

Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool’s offer of close to £100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £40million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with £40million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. ______ It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool’s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike Tottenham’s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player’s agent for his role in the England international’s ongoing contract saga — and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers’ criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as ‘Uncle Aidy’. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has ‘more kids than caps’ when he admits to one daughter — he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training — but denies a second child. But Sterling’s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. ‘As a young kid I had anger issues,’ Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up ‘in prison’ if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was ‘amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker’. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling’s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose ‘mentality’ was ‘his strongest attribute’. He also described him as ‘a coach’s dream’. Gallen also praised Sterling’s mother — Nadine is a nurse — for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his ‘house parents’. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling’s value to Liverpool is earning roughly £6m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; £35,000-a-week compared with £150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling’s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of £100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club’s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song ‘from the Kop’. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his ‘agent is a ****’. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don’t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don’t take the dispute into the public arena if it’s not a pay rise you’re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward’s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a ‘beautiful house’ back in Jamaica. Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?","There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — Gareth Bale even — requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow.","After the rapper's gambling lifestyle and according to his family, including his mother Nadine, who wants to return to the motherland.",0.8410682082,0.8116275072,0.8260856867,0.0666666667,0.0,0.0666666667,0.0666666667

An unparalleled summer talent drain last year led many onlookers to predict a meltdown at St Mary's, yet they have gone on to defy the odds and produce a remarkable season. Saints are pushing for a top-four finish in the Barclays Premier League with six matches to go, although that success has led the vultures to once again circle overhead. Nathaniel Clyne (left) has attracted the glances of several top clubs with his performances for Southampton . Clyne, out of contract next summer, is one such target and this week fuelled mounting speculation over a move to United by talking about his desire to play in the Champions League. Koeman twice won the competition as a player and fully understands Clyne's ambitions, and therefore the difficulty Saints may face in getting him to stay. 'It's up to the press how they take those kind of comments,' the Dutchman said. 'I like to play Champions League as well but that's the aspiration for every football player and it's a normal aspiration. If you don't mention that, there's something wrong. 'We are still in talking with the agent of Clyney, but it's difficult. I read in the press there's some interest. 'Nobody knocked on the door with an offer for Clyne, but we know (he has) one season on his contract and we want Clyne to stay at the club. Clyne made his full England debut last November . 'We need understanding for that but nothing else. 'We hope one day we will compare to the big ones, but that's difficult. ______ 'Of course we have to do everything to keep the player in the team, but I like to know it as soon as possible - not in the last week of the season, but earlier on. 'I mentioned April but by the end of April, the first week of May, it's good to know something about his situation.' Clyne will be hoping to start for Saints at Stoke this weekend, having been dropped to the bench for the win against Hull. Filip Djuricic and Victor Wanyama will be absent for the trip to the Britannia Stadium, as will long-term absentees Fraser Forster, Emmanuel Mayuka and Jay Rodriguez. It is more than a year since the latter last featured for Saints, having ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in defeat at Manchester City. There is at last some positive news for Rodriguez, though, with the forward set to join up with first-team training for 'some parts of the sessions' from next week. 'I hope that he can play a part in one of them maybe last one,' Koeman said. 'Maybe it will be on one side a tough one (to return in) because it is Man City and he got this injury against them. 'That will be nice to end the season but the focus has to be next season and if he is part of one or two games this season it will be great for him, great for the team, great for the club. Adam Lallana was part of the Southampton exodus as he left St Mary's for Liverpool . Lallana was joined at Anfield by Dejan Lovren but Southampton have barely been affected by their absence . 'He is putting everything in to get back, but we are not in a hurry. If he comes back he has to be 100 per cent and that's most important.' Rodriguez's return to fitness will bring with it heightened speculation about his future. Like Clyne and Morgan Schneiderlin, the 25-year-old has been linked with a move away from St Mary's, with the likes of Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool mentioned. But Koeman said: 'Of course I expect we don't sell the player. The player didn't play in my first season as a manager. 'He's good guy, a positive one and a good player, and maybe that will be the best transfer what we can do for the next season.'","We know our level, we know our possibilities. 'The club can't fight against big teams in the Premier League because the money and the possibilities of them are still much higher than we have.' Koeman's understanding will only last for so long, though, and the Southampton manager wants Clyne's future sorted before the end of the campaign.

The British Formula 1 racer drew criticism from around the world when he aimed the fizz directly as the face of 23-year-old grid girl Liu Siying, who was pictured looking less than impressed. But the Shanghai Institute of Visual Art graduate, who was a 'podium girl' at the Chinese Grand Prix, said she didn't think much about the incident and wasn't annoyed. Scroll down for video . Liu Siying was pictured grimacing as Lewis Hamilton sprayed champagne at her face after winning the race . Sexism campaigners called Hamilton's behaviour 'selfish' but Siying said she did not think too much about it . The hostess said: 'I was told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that's what I did' 'It lasted for only one or two seconds, and I did not think too much about it at all,' Miss Siying told the Shanghai Daily. 'I think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic compared to local media. 'I was just told by my employer to stand on the podium, and that’s what I did.' Miss Siying had asked to work as a podium model on the stage of the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai because she was a fan of Finnish driver Kimi Raikkonen. After the incident on Sunday, Object, a campaign group against sexism, condemned the behaviour of the driver as 'selfish and inconsiderate' and called on Hamilton to apologise to the graduate. Others have called the driving ace an 'embarrassment to the UK', while another said his actions showed that he was an 'ignorant clown'. Scroll down for video . It's not the first time racing ace Lewis Hamilton has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he's also done it after winning the Spanish Grand Prix and even at the Austrian Grand Prix, where he lost out on the top spot . After seeing the pictures the chief executive of campaign group Object asked for Hamilton to apologise . Speaking on Monday, Roz Hardie, chief executive of Object said Miss Siying would have had ittle choice but to 'stand there and take it'. She said: 'The photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed, but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face, which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part. 'If this if the case we think Lewis Hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future. For most people, it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it. 'It is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it. That is something of which he should be aware. But instead, he appears to have abused her position. 'It's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour.' Ms Hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world. Hamilton also sprayed a hostess at Montmelo after winning the Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Catalunya . She said: 'Motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves. We would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women. On Twitter, Hamilton was described as a 'bully' and 'disgusting'.

It wasn't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between Hamilton and his teammate Nico Rosberg . The Mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning on Sunday . His Mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel. With the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops, Rosberg reported on the radio that ‘Lewis is driving very slowly. Tell him to speed up.’ Hamilton, seemingly protecting his tyres, was given the hurry-up by Mercedes and both he and Rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with Vettel third. The world champion, sitting beside his teammate, told the press conference yesterday: 'I wasn't controlling his race, I was controlling my own race. 'My goal was to look after my car. I had no real threat from Nico throughout the whole race.' A visibly angry Rosberg replied: 'It's just now interesting to hear from you Lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race. Nico Rosberg (left) accused Hamilton of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under pressure . 'Driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant Sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then I had to cover him. 'It was unnecessarily close with Sebastian as a result, and also it cost me a lot of race time because I had to cover him. Then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer, so I'm unhappy about that.' The spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre, and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded. It culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the Belgian Grand Prix, resulting in Rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team. This proved to be a turning point in the championship as Hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown.","And one tweeted: 'Shame on you F1 and Lewis Hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration#sexism.'

For the next 48 hours, however, the pint will have to stay behind the bar as Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood go toe to toe in the scrap for survival. As far as QPR manager Ramsey is concerned, Sherwood’s Aston Villa are in no danger of tumbling out of the Barclays Premier League, despite their lowly position. The verdict is delivered on the evidence that Ramsey has gathered in four years of working alongside Sherwood at Tottenham. Chris Ramsey believes his friend and neighbour Tim Sherwood will keep Aston Villa in the Premier League . But the QPR boss will be pulling no punches when he clashes with his former Tottenham colleague on Tuesday . QPR scored four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since March 1994 v Norwich (4-3). ‘Without a shadow of a doubt I think he will keep them up,’ said Ramsey. ‘He has a good squad, players who have the wow factor and he knows how to manipulate those particular players. 'If I was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do, I would be putting a bet on him keeping them up.’ Ramsey will be doing his utmost to extend Villa’s top-flight uncertainty on Tuesday night and has reason for optimism given Rangers’ stunning victory at West Bromwich Albion. Ramsey says if he 'was a betting man, which we’re not allowed to do,' he would bet on Villa staying up . ______ ‘Me, him and Les (Ferdinand) live probably 10 minutes from each other so sometimes there is a pint to be had. I’m sure we’ll speak before the game,’ added Ramsey. ‘We worked together at Tottenham for four years in various jobs,’ said Ramsey. ‘It’s great you can have two coaches who’ve gone through the system and are coaching in the Premier League. The game has to look at it from an English point of view. ‘If things hadn’t gone our way against West Brom then the mountain looks a little bit bigger. The game will be very important for both teams.’ Ramsey and Sherwood were in the trenches together at Spurs and live within 10 minutes of each other . The perspective for Ramsey’s team is more positive after putting four past a West Brom side who for the first half looked to have beach on the brain already. Joey Barton scored in added time at the Hawthorns to underline the emphatic victory, having six minutes earlier received a forearm in the face from Youssouf Mulumbu that saw the Albion midfielder sent off. That ended any chance of a comeback for the hosts, who trailed 3-0 at the break but pulled one back through Victor Anichebe. First half goals from Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora, who scored a wonderful lob with the outside of his left boot, did the damage. Eduardo Vargas celebrates the opener for QPR in the remarkable 4-1 win over West Brom on Saturday . Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob to give his side a 3-0 half-time lead . Austin’s strike was his 16th in the Premier League this season and Barton suggested he would have an England cap by now were he in a more fashionable side. ‘It helps if you play for certain clubs to play for England,’ said the QPR midfielder. ‘Certain people who haven’t done as well as Charlie, who has scored so many goals in a struggling side, seem to be shoo-ins in the England side.’ QPR captain Joey Barton celebrates his goal, his team's fourth, late in the game at The Hawthorns .","QPR celebrate the second of their four goals against West Brom from Charle Austin (right) A second win in the Birmingham area in four days would send QPR above Villa on goal difference.

The 26-year-old rides well-backed The Druids Nephew, stepping in for broken leg victim Barry Geraghty on the Neil Mulholland-trained gelding which won on the opening day of last month's Cheltenham Festival. The eight-year-old is a 12-1 shot for the £1million steeplechase but Coleman knows more than most how fickle fortune can be in the biggest steeplechase in the world. Jockey Aidan Coleman (left) exits the weighing room at Haydock racecourse back in April earlier this year . The Druids Nephew ridden by Barry Geraghty clears the last jump during Day One of Cheltenham 2015 . As a 20-year-old, Coleman chose to ride seventh fence faller Stan, a disappointment turned into a calamity at the time because he had decided against partnering successful Venetia Williams-trained stablemate Mon Mome who lifted the prize at 100-1 with stand-in rider Liam Treadwell basking in glory. It was the only time in three National runs for Mon Mome that Coleman had not ridden the gelding. Coleman's two latest rides in the race have seen him unseated from a hampered The Rainbow Hunter. Coleman said: 'The Mom Mome incident was quite a blow at the time because I had a choice (of mounts) and picked the wrong one. I rode him the year before and the year afterwards, I just wasn't on him on the right day but that is just the way it goes. 'Sometimes you are ahead and sometimes you are behind – that is life in general. 'At the time I was 20, very young in life as well as racing. It was probably the first negative thing to happen in my career. 'Up until then I had never been injured, I had ridden out my claim in 14 months and was champion conditional. Since then there have been lots of good days and lots of bad days, so you become more streetwise and thicker skinned. 'I didn't had the best of luck on The Rainbow Hunter. He jumped well both times but ran into traffic problems and was more of less brought down last year. 'There is an element of luck required in any race but that applies more with the National because of the nature of the fences and the distance.'

Abramovich (right) celebrates with Frank Lampard (centre) and John Terry after Chelsea clinch their first Premier League title under his ownership in 2005 . The Russian finally got his hands on the Champions League trophy following Chelsea's success in 2012 . Mourinho also believes Chelsea’s adherence to FFP — ‘compared with other clubs and owners who didn’t want to play under the rules’, he pointed out in a thinly veiled dig at Manchester City — positions them as standard bearers for the English game. There can certainly be no doubt Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates for £140m on June 1, 2003. In the intervening 12 years he has spent in the region of £842.9m on transfer fees, winning three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League, but now, Mourinho says, Abramovich’s rule will benefit England as well as Chelsea. Jose Mourinho, seen here with Abramovich in 2004, has has been in charge of Chelsea for almost five of the Russian's 12 seasons at Stamford Bridge . The Blues have won three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one Europa League and one Champions League since 2004 . ‘He has been good for Chelsea, good for English football, good for European football,’ said Mourinho, who has been in charge for almost five of those 12 seasons. ‘Chelsea after him became strong, a top club in the country and a top club in Europe. I think that’s very, very good. I think it’s important and I think it’s also important the message Mr Abramovich and this club are passing now. ‘The decision to accept the [Financial Fair Play] rules and play under the rules I think is a big decision compared with other clubs and other owners that didn’t accept the rules and didn’t want to play under the rules. Chelsea are in a far stronger position than when Abramovich bought the club from Ken Bates in 2003 . ‘Will the next 700 games under him be good for the English national side? I believe so. In the first team, we had some important players in the national team. 'John Terry, Ashley Cole, Joe Cole, Frank Lampard, Wayne Bridge, Shaun Wright-Phillips. We had a nucleus of four, five players that were always in the national team. ‘Now we are going through a period where it’s just about Gary Cahill. ______ Mourinho believes the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek (left) and Dominic Solanke will represent Chelsea and England for years to come . Mourinho did not name them, but Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford, Lewis Baker and Isaiah Brown are thought to be highly-rated at Chelsea, who supply many of the players in England’s age-group teams. The question is whether their young English players will be given the chance in the first team at a club who can take a huge step towards the title by winning at QPR today. It is a game Chelsea go into mindful of decisive slips in last season’s title race but with the title firmly in their own hands now, Mourinho is confident no mistakes will be made. Chelsea are on the verge of a domestic double after picking up the Capital One Cup in March . Mourinho has won seven major trophies while in charge of the west London club . He added: ‘Don’t make me remember the game against Sunderland because that was the game which stopped us fighting for the title. I don’t want to speak again about that game. ‘Last season we were depending on others. We needed this team to lose a couple of points here, a couple of points there. This situation is different. ‘Now we are in a position where we can be isolated of everything. We don’t have to be watching Man City against Man United. We don’t have to be waiting for what they are going to do. It’s just us.’ Fabio Borini celebrates scoring the winning goal during Sunderland's 2-1 win against Chelsea last season . Mourinho believes last season's defeat against Sunderland 'stopped' Chelsea from fighting for the title .","But we have some young boys coming into the first-team.

Normally, in a few years they should be there [in the national side].’ Gary Cahill (above) is now Chelsea's only senior England international in the current first team squad .","The missing sentences are:

Videos of the South Korean defender Kim Min Hyeok, who plays for Sagan Tosu, have gone viral after he allegedly brutally stamped on the face of opponent Mu Kanazaki. Sagan are ninth in the J-League and furious claims have been made that the 23-year-old deliberately committed the horrific foul after being jostled by 11th-placed Kashima Antlers player Kanazaki.

Whether or not the foul was intentional, it is suspected that the reason for Japanese  fans’ outcry is not so much the act itself, but the fact that it was committed by a South Korean player. Hyeok's boot appears to scrape down Kanazaki's face, but the man on the floor came out as the winner later . Hyeok was somehow only shown a yellow card for the challenge that infuriated fans at the stadium .

Celtic want to keep Manchester City defender Jason Denayer (left) on loan for another season . Hearts captain Danny Wilson is another defensive target for Celtic manager Ronny Deila . But, with Denayer due to spend pre-season with his parent club in a bid to prove himself, there is no guarantee he will return, and certainly not in time for Celtic's Champions League qualifying campaign beginning in mid-July. So Deila confirmed he would look to sign a centre-back and responded to reports that former Rangers player Wilson was among his list of potential targets. 'That is one of many names we are talking about but there is nothing serious in that,' Deila said. 'But he's a good player.' Deila, who spent last week watching Norway training before their 5-1 defeat in Croatia, added: 'Jason is going back to Manchester City after the season to have a pre-season and we will see if we can get him back or not. That is something we want, but we have to co-operate with City. 'But I think it's good for him to stay here because hopefully we will get Champions League qualification and that will make him even more experienced. 'Jason is ambitious - he wants to play at the highest level he can. But it's playing that is the most important thing, and playing at Manchester City is very, very hard. If not, I think Celtic is a good club for him.' Celtic boss Ronny Deila has confirmed that he will ask Manchester City if he can keep Denayer next season . Denayer rises highest to score against Aberdeen at Celtic Park at the beginning of last month . Celtic were involved in another loan deal this week when 18-year-old midfielder Liam Henderson joined Rosenborg until the summer. Henderson has made 22 first-team appearances, but competition has increased recently with the signings of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven. 'Rosenborg called me and asked if we had a midfielder that could be available and Liam Henderson is a very, very talented player and he needs games,' Deila said. 'This was a good move for him. We have a lot of options in midfield and he can play until July 1 and get as much experience as possible. It's a big club as well - the biggest club in Norway, high expectations there. This will give him more experience as a player and a person. 'He was quite keen and that's what good about Liam - he is so ambitious. He really wants to play and develop all the time. 'He saw this as a very good move for him and I made it quite clear that it's not as if I don't want him - it's just because I think it's good for his development. If I was selfish, I would keep him here.' Denayer, pictured celebrating a goal in August last year, is hoping to break into Manchester City's first-team . When asked if more Scottish players should experience playing abroad, Deila said: 'Abroad or not, I'm not sure what is best, but you have to learn a different culture, different ways of playing football, which is positive, and also learning a language and getting away from a safe environment. 'They are positive things but the most important thing is to get experience on the pitch.' Deila is hoping to get all of his players back fit from international duty ahead of their Scottish Premiership clash at St Mirren Park on Friday night, but Charlie Mulgrew (hamstring tendon) and Mikael Lustig (ankle) are still missing. 'Charlie is progressing, the same with Lustig, but the two injuries are very hard to get right,' Deila said. 'Things are going in the right direction but we have to be patient because if we start too early they will have the same injury again and we will be another two or three months.

Strauss said on Saturday that he can see no way back for the man he fell out with so badly over the messages Pietersen sent to South African opponents apparently criticising him as captain three years ago. Pietersen begins his county comeback with Surrey against Oxford University in The Parks on Sunday having been encouraged to return to the domestic game by ECB chairman-elect Colin Graves and emboldened by the demise of Downton, the man who sacked him last year. Andrew Strauss (right) says the Kevin Pietersen affair is a 'distraction' for English cricket . Strauss and Pietersen pictured during happier times during the 2011 series with India . Yet his hopes of an England return would seem over if Strauss succeeds in becoming the new England director of cricket after throwing his hat into the ring on Friday. ‘It’s very important for English cricket to move on from the Kevin Pietersen situation,’ said Strauss, who infamously called Pietersen ‘a complete c***’ on air last season when he thought his microphone had been switched off. ‘That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than him actually playing. It’s become that big. The ECB and the England team’s efforts to move on from him haven’t worked so far but by winning that will allow them to move forward.’ Strauss’s views are as much from a cricketing point of view as a personal one, even though his feelings towards Pietersen clearly have not changed. ‘If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after the Ashes is over, it’s quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side,’ Strauss told Wisden editor and Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth on the Lord’s podcast. ‘You’re building towards the next Ashes in two and a half years time and the World Cup in 2019. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey for the county season in an attempt to regain his England place . Pietersen's chances of a recall have been boosted by the likely appointment of Michael Vaughan in the new ECB director of cricket role created following the sacking of Paul Downton as managing director . ‘I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can’t see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time. I think after the Ashes the story does move forward at that point.’ Michael Vaughan remains favourite to pip Strauss for a role that would have powers not enjoyed by anyone in English cricket since Ray Illingworth in the Nineties. ______ There were key figures who wanted Strauss to take the job when Hugh Morris stood down 18 months ago, not least the Welshman himself, but at that stage Strauss felt it was too early for him and he has dabbled in commentary while not being a natural at it like Nasser Hussain and Atherton. Pietersen and Vaughan pictured together on England duty at Lord's in 2008 . Strauss, who played in 82 Tests with Pietersen, believes his recall would only be a short-term measure . Now the new regime at the ECB have moved the goalposts and the man Graves and Harrison want is clearly Vaughan, if they can persuade him to give up his extensive lucrative media work and other cricketing interests. Vaughan is here to commentate on England’s three-Test series against West Indies for Test Match Special and intriguingly is staying at the same hotel as the team. It will be fascinating to see whether he changes a hard-hitting commentary style that has seen him criticise several of the players who he may well now take charge of, with the ECB looking to make a quick appointment. Vaughan will need to build some bridges himself with a number of England players if he takes over but clearly Graves is not concerned by what has happened in the past and feels his fellow Yorkshireman is perfect for the role. Jimmy Anderson, who will be playing his 100th Test needing four wickets to become England’s leading wicket-taker, did not want to get drawn into which of his former England captains should get the big job. England bowler Jimmy Anderson refused to be drawn on who he would prefer to take up the role . ‘I don’t really have an opinion because we’re concentrating on building up to a Test,’ said Anderson. ‘That’s for the two new guys in charge. They’ve obviously got a clear plan of where they want to take English cricket and I’m sure they’ll get the right man for the job.’ Even though it was a diplomatic answer it was perhaps revealing that Anderson then named Hussain and Strauss as the best captains he has worked under, a view that was consistent with his autobiography where he offered little praise to the 2005 Ashes-winning captain Vaughan. Clearly, Peter Moores and even Alastair Cook will be almost auditioning for Vaughan in this series and it is impossible to see Moores in particular carrying on as coach alongside a man in Vaughan who has been so critical of him. The distractions that Strauss talked about, not just those provided by Pietersen, clearly still loom large over an England team who, it should be remembered, won the last three Tests they have played. It is imperative, not least for their captain and coach, that they continue that run here.","Graves and new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison want to overhaul the system and make the new man more the equivalent of a football manager than a managing director, as was Downton. That means the director of cricket will probably be a hands-on presence in the dressing room with overall responsibility for coaching and selection, with the panel of selectors almost certainly being disbanded.",Michael Vaughan remains,0.7930681705,0.7893853188,0.7912224531,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone. It’s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six. Have Hull got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run-in? Are Leicester too far back? Burnley have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise? Have QPR improved enough away from home to take any confidence to Leicester on the final day? Sportsmail considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict. Sunderland . Position: 15th on 29 points . Jermain Defoe (centre) reinvigorated Sunderland with a stunning strike to beat rivals Newcastle 1-0 . Dick Advocaat is overseeing Sunderland's survival bid as manager until the end of the season . Seven points split Sunderland in 15th and Leicester in 20th as the battle for Premier League survival heats up . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Crystal Palace (H) -D . Stoke (A) - D . Southampton (H) - L . Everton (A) - L . Leicester (H) - W . Arsenal (A) - L . Chelsea (A) L . Predicted total: 34 points . Verdict: Safe . Their derby win will have done them the world of good, as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in Palace, Stoke and Everton who have very little to play for. They need to make the most of those initial fixtures because it’s highly unlikely that they will get anything out of closing trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. Aston Villa . Position: 16th on 29 points . Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday . Tim Sherwood has helped Villa rediscover their scoring touch since replacing Paul Lambert as manager . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester City (A) - L . Everton (H) - D . West Ham (H) - W . Southampton (A) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Predicted total: 36 points . Verdict: Safe . At this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what Villa have. However, with only three home wins this season (one less than on the road) they face a challenge. They ought to be OK, not least because a team that struggled to score under Paul Lambert has improved under Tim Sherwood. Hull . Position: 17th on 28 points . Steve Bruce's Hull  are placed perilously above the drop zone in 17th with seven games remaining . Ahmed Elmohamady will be a key man in Hull's bid to protect their position outside of the relegation zone . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Southampton (A) - L . Liverpool (H) - D . Crystal Palace (A) - D . Arsenal (H) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester United (H) - L . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Safe. On goal difference. The hardest run-in of the lot? It looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival. There are two points between them and QPR at the moment, but Hull could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference, which is six better than QPR’s. Their fixtures are simply awful. Crystal Palace are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive. QPR . Position: 18th on 26 points . Charlie Austin has netted 17 goals in 29 games for QPR and will be vital during his team's difficult run-in . Chris Ramsey may find QPR's goal difference a big disadvantage, particularly with a tough final seven games . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Chelsea (H) - L . West Ham (H) - W . Liverpool (A) - L . Man City (A) - L . Newcastle (H) - W . Leicester (A) - D . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Relegated on goal difference . Three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that Liverpool and Manchester City – games you would expect them to lose anywhere – are played away. That places huge emphasis on home games against West Ham and Newcastle, neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for. It could all come down to the final game of the season, which is away at Leicester. Chris Ramsey has improved their away form but it is a big ask. Their poor goal difference in relation to Hull’s could be the deciding factor. Burnley . Position: 19th on 26 points . Danny Ings will spearhead Burnley's attack as they attempt to escape the Premier League relegation zone . Sean Dyche's side have two relegation crunch matches away from home against Hull and Villa . Predicted results: Six points from seven games . Arsenal (H) – L . Everton (A) - D . Leicester (H) – W . West Ham (A) - D . Hull (A) - L . Stoke (H) - D .

Burnley (A) - L . Chelsea (H) - L . Newcastle (H) - D . Southampton (H) - D . Sunderland (A) - L . QPR (H) - D . Predicted total: 26 points . Verdict: Relegated . As with Burnley, it’s not the most intimidating run-in and they do have the most games from which to gain points. They also have the slight advantage of five fixtures at home.

Bayern were without wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as well as David Alaba, who tore a knee ligament and will be out for about two months. They were also missing defender Holger Badstuber, forcing coach Pep Guardiola to overhaul his team and play a new-look midfield with captain Philipp Lahm, Xabi Alonso and Bastian Schweinsteiger. 'I would have liked to have played differently but I have to adapt the system to my players,' said Guardiola. Neuer advances from his line to beat Reus to the ball during the clash at Signal Iduna Park . Manager Pep Guardiola is having to content with a number of injuries ahead of the German Cup quarter-final . Guardiola, in his second season in charge after winning the domestic double last year, will have the chance to slightly alter his system again with midfielder Thiago Alcantara making a comeback on Saturday after more than a year out injured. ______ Ribery could also be back in time for Wednesday's game, providing Guardiola with more punching power. Leverkusen, eager to remain in the top four to secure yet another Champions League campaign next season, have won their last five Bundesliga games without conceding a goal as they hit top form. Former Barcelona midfielder Thiago Alcantara made his first appearance for a year against Dortmund . 'We want to advance but we know it will be hard,' Leverkusen's Gonzalo Castro said. 'We know what we can do and we can play with confidence. Our counter attacks are extremely fast and good. After our 4-0 win and five straight victories our confidence is very high.' In another all-Bundesliga clash Borussia Dortmund, finalists last season, take on Hoffenheim on Tuesday eager to edge closer to the final and a possible European spot after a dismal league showing this season.

That’s not to say this was a bad day for Everton. They have had plenty of those in this long season over land and sea and could yet finish in the lower half of the Premier League for the first time since 2006. But this one frustrated the Spaniard. His side have found a degree of freedom since their European travels came to an end and in winning three on the trot they started to resemble the side that blitzed their way through last season. Jonjo Shelvey converted from 12 yards to rescue a point for Swansea after Seamus Coleman handled in the penalty box . Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder sends Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard the wrong way . The midfielder salutes the home crowd after netting the equaliser for Swansea in the Saturday lunch-time kick-off . Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball, according to the watching Michael Oliver . Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting section at the full-time whistle . This game, in the mind of Martinez but not many others, should have been the fourth win of a streak. The contentious moment came in the second half when, having led through Lennon’s first-half strike, they conceded a penalty. Seamus Coleman was under pressure from Marvin Emnes, fell forward under marginal contact and then handled the ball. Martinez called for a foul on Coleman; Michael Oliver called a penalty for handball and Jonjo Shelvey buried the kick. Everton’s manager seethed as three points became one and then gave the kind of comments that suggested this fixture was not the dead rubber it appeared to be. ‘We feel like it was a defeat,’ he said. ‘It is difficult to take. I am very satisfied with the performance because they are a difficult side to play. Look at the way they open teams up like Arsenal and Manchester United. ‘For the first 20 or 25 minutes of the second half it was too easy. We just couldn’t find the second goal. You are exposed at 1-0 and something happened. ‘Seamus felt there was contact. Seamus loses his balance and as he falls he ends up touching the ball with his hand. There was no goalscoring threat whatsoever. The referee in those moments can make his own decision but I think it was very harsh. ‘He should have applied a bit of common sense. From my point of view, seeing it in a biased way, I would have wanted to see a free-kick awarded. Two or three actions straight after it was exactly the same and given as a free-kick. That is disappointing. You want some consistency.’ Swansea City (4-3-3): Fabianski 6.5; Rangel 6, Fernandez 6, Williams 6, Taylor 6; Ki 6.5, Cork 6.5, Shelvey 7.5 (Dyer 83); Sigurdsson 6, Gomis 6 (Emnes 17, 6.5), Routledge 6.5 .

MOM: Jonjo Shelvey . ______ Aaron Lennon celebrates with Seamus Coleman and Ross Barkley (left) after he opened the scoring for Everton at the Liberty Stadium . Lennon, on loan from Tottenham for the remainder of the season, fires in his second goal in three games for Roberto Martinez's side . Lennon's strike in the 41st minute came against the run of play with Swansea having dominated much of the opening half . While an argument could be made for the penalty, the comments on performance were less easy to accept. Swansea did not deserve to win but they certainly did not deserve to lose a game in which Garry Monk felt Arouna Kone might been sent off. There was also a wonderful goal from Shelvey disallowed in the first half because Wayne Routledge was adjudged to have fouled Leighton Baines. It appeared to be a harsh call. Monk said: ‘I was disappointed with the disallowed goal. I thought it was very harsh on what could have been one of the goals of the season.’ So, one referee and two disgruntled managers. Monk at least had the consolation of watching Shelvey have one of those days when the correct parts of his brain are in operation. He is capable of winning matches and losing matches - a blessing and a curse dictated by his emotions. But he was excellent here, driving Swansea early in the game before Lennon put Everton in front on 41 minutes. Fittingly it was Shelvey whose penalty ultimately claimed Swansea's 47th point of the season – equalling their Premier League record from 2012. Monk said: ‘The plan was three points and to get it (the record) in front of our fans. There is a slight disappointment and that shows how far we have come.’ Garry Monk and Roberto Martinez share an embrace in the dugout ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash at the Liberty Stadium .

68051,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,1418,1,4,"They’ve won seven on the spin in the Premier League and made Liverpool look like relegation candidates as opposed to Champions League rivals during Saturday’s first-half slaughter. So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a ‘no contest’. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday . This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack – and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year’s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger’s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they’re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form . A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years. Interestingly, Wenger’s policy of chasing the best British talent could be on the way out. Yes, there was the capture of Danny Welbeck last summer, but that was more opportunistic than a long-term pursuit. Welbeck, in turn, has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as Liverpool were torn apart. ______ Teams which win titles have players who, in short, play. Jack Wilshere (centre) watches on from the stands on Saturday after missing out through injury . Theo Walcott (left) has struggled since returning from a year-long injury lay-off . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey have both started just 17 of 31 league games. For the latter, a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season. So while there is the promise of better times ahead, issues remain for Wenger to sort. You feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the Emirates. But then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure. Wenger needs to think big this summer, or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply.","So, too, did Theo Walcott. He has the mitigation of injury, of course, but does Wenger trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign? Likewise, Jack Wilshere.","The blank written by ""=head""",0.8129365444,0.8024352789,0.8076517582,0.0606060606,0.0,0.0606060606,0.0606060606
83135,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l3,1732,0,5,"For Celtic, a slow-burning season has seen Ronny Deila’s side raise their game after a stuttering start and eventually rout their nearest rivals. Their steady emergence under the Norwegian has seen them swat aside second-placed Aberdeen 8-2 on aggregate over three matches and eradicate fourth-placed Dundee United 17-3 over the course of six games. Yet although the Parkhead side have in recent times looked like an increasingly irresistible force in the race for the treble, it has been left to third-placed Inverness Caley Thistle to enhance their credentials as the team most likely to represent a potential stumbling block on Ronny Deila’s march towards history. Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . In three games this season, there has been nothing between these two teams. In August, Celtic lost 1-0 at Tulloch Caledonian Stadium, before gaining revenge with a 1-0 win at Parkhead in November. On Saturday, Deila’s side were held to a draw by Caley Thistle. Yet while Celtic were surprisingly poor, the evidence from the weekend also suggests that Inverness possess a potent blend of passion and physicality which, more so than any other side in the country, seems to knock Deila’s men out of their stride. For goalkeeper Craig Gordon, Saturday’s 1-1 draw - which included a quick-fire goal from Leigh Griffiths and one in immediate response Edward Ofere - served as a warning shot against complacency in the quest for a rare domestic clean sweep. ______ ‘They were up for it and they put us under a bit of pressure today. They’ve got a little bit of everything about them and, on any given day, they are more than capable of winning a game. ‘They pressed us high and they will try to do that again at Hampden. Hopefully we will learn from this and play better. But the one thing we know for sure is that we will be in for a battle next weekend.’ Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring . Ofere (left) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for Inverness against Celtic . Celtic found it tough to play on a bumpy surface at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium. But Gordon reckons the recently re-laid turf at Hampden will benefit Inverness just as much as the treble-chasers. ‘It will be a different venue on a different pitch but that won’t have any bearing,’ he said. ‘The pitch at Hampden will help us but it will be good for Inverness as well because they like to pass the ball about. ‘Both sides were aggressive today in trying to press, there was nothing nasty about it. Everyone was just trying to get one over their direct opponent ahead of the semi final and neither team wanted to lose ahead of next weekend. ‘We all know next weekend is a big one but we’ve also got a midweek league match (against Kilmarnock) at home on Wednesday night sandwiched right in the middle of these two Inverness games. ‘We need to keep picking up points. If we can win against Kilmarnock we can go into the semi-final high on confidence and looking to beat Inverness.’ If Celtic felt ill at ease on a poor pitch and blowing wind, it did not show as the elements played a part in the opening goal after just 135 seconds. The wind held up Scott Brown’s long ball and Griffiths set himself up before blasting past Dean Brill from 25 yards for a terrific goal. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic . Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match . Inverness were level almost straight away, however, when David Raven’s shanked shot was directed goalwards by Ryan Christie. Belgian defender Jason Denayer cleared the ball off the line but only as far as Nigeria forward Ofere, who was there to ram home his second goal for Caley Thistle since joining the club in January. It had been a breathtaking opening five minutes but the next incident of note was a horror show for Brill as the enthusiastic Gary Mackay-Steven chased down a loose ball and accidentally caught the Caley Thistle keeper, who collapsed to the deck in agony. As the keeper was treated by medics on the park, Mackay-Steven kept checking on the welfare of his stricken opponent. Jeered for his role in the incident, Mackay-Steven seemed spooked afterwards and fell out of the game, before being substituted by Kris Commons just after the hour mark. There was precious little else to talk about in the remainder of the match, apart from some decent saves by Brill’s replacement Ryan Esson from Efe Ambrose and Denayer - while Celtic captain Scott Brown was booked for ‘simulation’ after colliding with Raven in the box. Afterwards, Deila backed his man, saying Brown was ‘the last man in the world anyone can accuse of diving.’ Deila added: ‘He is a tough guy. It’s not a big issue.’ Keeper Gordon, meanwhile, tried to remain philosophical over two lost points in a title race which has been going Celtic’s way for quite some time. ‘I think a point was probably fair today. It’s always tough here and you always get a battle,’ he said. ‘That’s pretty much what it was like as the game never really settled down or had any real pattern to it. ‘We couldn’t impose ourselves and do what we wanted to do. The conditions were difficult, but it was the same for them. Both teams created a few opportunities but not too many and a draw was fair. We will need to be better next Sunday if we are to get a result.’","The Scotland goalkeeper believes his side will need to fight with every sinew when the two tribes renew hostilities in Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi final at Hampden if Celtic’s dream of winning a fourth treble is not to be shattered. ‘It’s a good little reminder that we are in for a big fight next week,’ said the Scotland international. ‘Inverness are a good team.

Rojo's identity in the case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. She said: ‘He came over to me and sat down. His English was quite bad but he was chatty and said nice things to me about how I looked and how he liked my Versace dress. ‘He said “You’re gorgeous, you’re the best looking girl in here.” It was all very cheesy, but he’s so good looking that I gave him my number.’ Rojo invited her to his friend’s flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. “My love, where are you?” he asked. ‘It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.’ So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo’s – known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit – made a shocking proposition. ‘He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.’ But she did find the Argentine star’s dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. ‘I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,’ she said. The Argentine defender was in action for Manchester United against Aston Villa on Saturday . Rojo celebrates with team-mate Di Maria after the 3-1 victory at Old Trafford in the Premier League . Watson says that the 25-year-old offered her money to spend the night with him - which she declined - and then accepted a £30,000 offer from a newspaper to sell her story. She never received that money, and Sarah then says Rojo's representatives tried to entrap her with promises of cash to spin the story. Watson said: ‘[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me £100,000 as hush money.' ______ Watching from the stands as Rojo impressed at Old Trafford against Tim Sherwood's side at the weekend, was his wife Eugenia Lusardo, a lingerie model based in Lisbon, and their young daughter, Morena.

Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel conjured one of the biggest surprises for many a Formula One season with the team's first victory for almost two years at the last race in Malaysia. Many people expected another dominant Mercedes campaign in the wake of last season's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in Australia. Lewis Hamilton was fastest in first practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix . The Mercedes driver, who leads the championship, set the pace as he bids to win his fourth race in China . Hamilton was over half-a-second clear of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in opening practice . 1. Lewis Hamilton  Mercedes 1:39.033 . 2. Nico Rosberg  Mercedes 1:39.574 . 3.

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari's success was 'a wake-up call' to his organisation. Without doubt Mercedes responded in the first practice session ahead of the latest race at the Shanghai International Circuit, and none more so than reigning champion Hamilton. A three-times winner at this track, including last season, Hamilton finished 0.541secs clear of team-mate Nico Rosberg, with a best lap of one minute 39.033secs. None of their rivals even came close, with Vettel a further half a second adrift at 1:40.157secs, with his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen 1.6secs down on Hamilton. Valtteri Bottas was ninth in his Williams, over two seconds shy of Hamilton's best time . Jenson Button was within three seconds of Hamilton's lap and 13th in the first practice standings . Fresh from winning in Malaysia, Vettel was best of the rest in Shanghai behind the two Mercedes drivers . To underline Mercedes' supremacy and the gap to Raikkonen, from the Finn in fourth to Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in 18th, there was a difference of just 1.5secs. Behind Mercedes and Ferrari, the best of the rest was Felipe Nasr in his Sauber, with the Brazilian rookie 1.979secs off the pace, whilst Daniel Ricciardo finished 1.996secs down for Red Bull. No other driver came within two seconds of Hamilton, with Daniil Kvyat seventh for Red Bull, followed by Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz. The Williams duo of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa completed the top 10, 2.27secs adrift and split by a mere one thousandth of a second. As for McLaren, Jenson Button was 13th and Fernando Alonso 17th, with the latter 3.128secs behind Hamilton, with even Jolyon Palmer ahead of him on his debut for Lotus. Last year's GP2 champion, serving as reserve with Lotus this season, was 15th and 2.934secs down, with highly-experienced team-mate Pastor Maldonado only 0.6secs ahead. Manor pair Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi both enjoyed plenty of track time, completing 38 laps between them. For young British rookie Stevens his 18 laps were crucial as he had so far failed to take part in either qualifying session or race in Australia and Malaysia.

Ozil was off the pace at the beginning of this season, but says he is now back to his best since returning to fitness in January. And the German star says his injury has actually helped him, claiming that it 'worked in my favour' after a busy schedule. Mesut Ozil trains ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi final against Reading on Saturday . The German star says he is now playing his best football since joining the Gunners in the summer of 2013 . Ozil said 10 years of playing football had taken their toll, but he has come to terms with the Premier League . Mesut Ozil is interviewed in this week's Sport . 'At the moment I am pleased with the consistency of my game,' Ozil told Sport magazine. 'I feel I am now playing my best football since joining Arsenal.' The playmaker was a big part of Germany's World Cup win over the summer, playing every game as Joachim Low's side lifted the trophy in Brazil, and the process took a lot out of him. 'I was exhausted at the start of the season,' he confesses. 'I started playing professional football at the age of 16 and had never really suffered many serious injuries. ' I guess 10 years of consistently playing football took its toll. I was also struggling with the physicality of this league.' ______ 'The injury worked in my favour in a way, as it gave me time to recover, to assess and to work on what was required to compete in this league,' he added. 'The football here is far more physical, it is played at a faster tempo and you have to adapt to the sheer number of games. 'I have had to work a lot harder and adjust my game accordingly. I used my time out with injury to work on my strength. I'm continuing to do extra sessions after training now.' The World Cup winning midfielder is continuing to do extra strength sessions after Arsenal training . Ozil was a key player in Germany's World Cup win, and admits it took a lot out of him last summer .","However, Ozil has bounced back in the second half of this season, his excellent form coinciding with a winning run that has seen the Gunners climb the table. And the 26-year-old midfielder has attributed his success, in part, to the injury that kept him out for three months this winter. Ozil celebrates scoring a goal in the convincing win against Liverpool, when he was in excellent form . Ozil has put his improved performances down to the strength training he went through after being injured .","The word to fill in the blank with 4 sentences is:

Bueno played for Derby on loan five years ago, but with just five goals in 29 games he looked anything like Champions League material. After returning to Valladolid he moved to Rayo Vallecano and at the club with one of the lowest budgets in Spanish football he has had the season of his life. Now Champions League quarter-finalists Porto, coached by Spaniard Julen Lopetegui, are ready to poach him. Alberto Bueno (left) in action for Derby against Norwich during his unsuccessful spell with the club . Bueno celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Real Union in November 2008 .

Rayo Vallecano (2013-) 65 apps, 26 goals . ______ Bueno came through at Real Madrid in the 2006-07 season when then manager Fabio Capello fast-tracked him from the C-team to train with David Beckham, Luis Figo and Raul. He eventually made his full debut in both La Liga and the Champions League two seasons later but like so many strikers from Real Madrid’s youth system before him he was going to have to leave to really launch his career. Following in the footsteps of Alvaro Negredo and Roberto Soldado he left the club in 2009 signing for Valladolid from where he spent a season at Derby before ending up back in Spain. Negredo and Soldado both made it into the Spain squad after they succeeded away from Madrid and national team boss Vicente Del Bosque will be watching on Wednesday when Bueno goes up against Sergio Ramos as Rayo Vallecano look to take the scalp of Real Madrid in their rickety atmosphere-charged three-sided Vallecas stadium.",Seventeen of the 35 goals that Rayo have scored this season have come from Bueno.

The divisive batsman has re-signed for Surrey this summer in an attempt to win an unlikely England recall, having been thrown an apparent lifeline by incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. He has not played in the LV= County Championship since 2013 but is set to start the season with the Brown Caps in the hope of turning the selectors' heads and reversing last year's controversial sacking. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey  after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . The 34-year-old has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. Pietersen announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers on Easter Sunday, raising the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. ______ He clearly feels Graves' words are encouragement enough of a Test recall but after so many bitter recriminations - and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography - there are still many bridges to build. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge both selectorial and public opinion from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed. Captain Alastair Cook, who was not given a glittering write-up in the Pietersen's book, largely absolved himself from the decision-making process, insisting it would be taken by Graves, managing director of England cricket Paul Downton and chief executive Tom Harrison. Coach Peter Moores was less ambiguous. Moores was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008, partially at the behest of Pietersen, whose intervention also cost him the captaincy. Incoming ECB chairman Graves advised that signing for a domestic side would help Pietersen's cause . Alastair Cook (left) was coy on Pietersen's chances of a recall but Peter Moores said he 'isn't on the radar' Moores was previously dismissed as England coach at the behest of Pietersen when he was captain . He was then belittled as a nagging 'woodpecker' in the the batsman's memoir and reconciliation between the two men would appear a stretch. Asked at Gatwick about the situation, Moores said: 'From my point of view, Kevin isn't on the radar.'

Enter Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers, a club and manager not just popping into the party to say a polite hello and a quick goodbye. Tonight, against Blackburn at Ewood Park, Rodgers faces one of those defining moments in a season that has not lacked them. His only hope must be that this time it doesn't go so horribly wrong. So far it has been a theme of the campaign that when the need was greatest, so too have been the disappointments. He loaded for duck on a bear hunt in the Champions League against Real Madrid and lost. He wanted to save his best resources for Chelsea and lost that game, too. Kolo Toure found the net in Liverpool's FA Cup clash with Blackburn but his effort was ruled out . Blackburn salute their fans at Anfield after earning a Sixth Round replay at home to the Premier League side . When the European portion of their season fizzled out, first in the big show and then in the Europa League, the Premier League offered an opportunity. Getting into the top-four without Luis Suarez and often in the absence of Daniel Sturridge would be an immense achievement. Having started the season so badly and recovered so impressively, it became a real possibility. Then two huge games - Manchester United and Arsenal. A chance. Steven Gerrard lost his mind, the defence lost the plot and Liverpool lost by a combined total of 6-2 across the two games. A top-four place is virtually gone, unless anyone can conceivably see them making up seven points and a massive goal difference on Manchester City. Suddenly, the romance of the FA Cup is a little more two-sided. They need it badly. Steven Gerrard's birthday falls on May 30, the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley . The FA Cup represents Liverpool's last chance of silverware after a disappointing season . 'I don't want to go down the route of saying that it saves our season,' said Rodgers before the replay of their quarter-final against Blackburn. 'Our objective at the start, though, was to win a trophy. 'So I think if we didn't get in the top four and we didn't have a trophy this year, we would be disappointed. I think certainly the FA Cup would give us a great boost as a team with lots of young players and players coming into the club. 'That's the expectancy we want. We want to be able to be challenging every year. 'That was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies. The FA Cup would mark a good step forward for us.' The need for trophies has been a dominant theme since Rodgers took over at Liverpool and made them contenders again. There is no denying the steps he has taken with the club and very little to suggest he is anything other than one of the sharpest managerial minds working in this country. Daniel Sturridge will be crucial to Liverpool's chances of reaching the FA Cup semi-final . Glen Johnson is in good spirits in training ahead of Liverpool's trip to Ewood Park on Wednesday . But how he will be tested if this season ends without either a top-four place or a trophy. ______ Rodgers can talk magnificently and persuasively but his sales pitches to leading players would be enhanced immeasurably if he could talk about current achievements. Something shiny and tangible and recently acquired would help. It's a tough ask. They face Blackburn with a defence looking as woefully shaky as it did at the start of the season. Without Martin Skrtel and Emre Can tonight that defence could be vulnerable again. Steven Gerrard is also missing. Not ideal, though not necessarily a tremendous setback against a Championship side. In any case, Liverpool and Rodgers need to find a way through. It has been three years since they last won a trophy – under Kenny Dalglish - and the FA Cup is a chance to stop the clock. It's a defining moment that must not end in another failure. Liverpool have not won a trophy since they beat Cardiff to win the Carling Cup three years ago . Real Madrid 1-0 Liverpool, November 4 . Finally back on the grandest stage, but Rodgers opted for a watered down XI. Dejan Lovren, Steven Gerrard, Raheem Stirling, Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Mario Balotelli played all previous Champions League matches but none of them started. The aim, it appeared, was to prioritise the following league game. Karim Benzema celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Liverpool at the Bernabeu . Liverpool 1-2 Chelsea, November 8 . It was time to vindicate the gamble in Madrid, which was widely criticised. Rodgers made seven changes to the side that lost in the Champions League and Emre Can put them ahead. But Chelsea won 2-1, leaving Liverpool eighth in the Premier League. Having rested a host of players in Madrid, Brendan Rodgers' side then lost a crunch league game to Chelsea . Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool, January 27 . After drawing the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, Liverpool blew a host of chances and fell to a stoppage-time winner. A big opportunity missed. The Stamford Bridge also knocked Liverpool out of the Capital One Cup following a 1-0 win at home . Besiktas 1-0 Liverpool, February 26 . Ten years after their Champions League miracle in Istanbul, Liverpool returned to face Besiktas in the Europa League last 32. They held a 1-0 first-leg lead. It went horribly wrong and they lost on penalties. 'Unfortunately, on this occasion, Istanbul is not a happy place,' said Rodgers . Demba Ba celebrates after Dejan Lovren missed the crucial penalty in the shoot-out against Besiktas . Arsenal 4-1 Liverpool, April 4 . Liverpool's last real shot at getting into the top four and it fell apart spectacularly. Raheem Sterling's unauthorised interview hardly helped matters in the build-up and the game was a disaster.

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. ______ Manchester City risk losing star man Sergio Aguero should they slip out of the Premier League's top four . Aguero scores the first of his two goals during City's 4-2 defeat at the hands of rivals Manchester United . It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. The Argentine forward clinched the Premier League title for City with this striker against QPR in 2012 . Aguero wheels away in celebration after giving the City faithful inside the Etihad a moment to remember . Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £38m for in 2011. Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. Aguero scores past United goalkeeper David de Gea to earn his 19th Premier League goal of the season . The City players look dejected during the 4-2 defeat which left their side fourth in the Premier League table . If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Manuel Pellegrini signed former Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony for £30million in January . April 19 West Ham United (H) April 25 Aston Villa (H) May 3 Tottenham Hotspur (A) May 10 Queens Park Rangers (H) May 17 Swansea City (A) May 24 Southampton (H) Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. The former Swansea City man, who cost just £10m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? City are reportedly targeting Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba as they look to strengthen this summer . The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Pellegrini's future as City boss is in doubt after a difficult 2014-15 campaign at the Etihad . Are they at fault for spending the best part of £200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.",But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have.,"To play as instructed, I will fill in the blank with a 1-word answer.

The ex-Chelsea defender came off the bench in Wednesday night's Champions League quarter-final first leg and was nutmegged twice by Luis Suarez in the build-up to the Uruguayan's two goals. Luiz suffered a hamstring injury 10 days ago but Hoddle, who insists that the Brazilian has always been a defensive liability, believes he still showed his naivety even if he wasn't fully fit.

Luiz suffered the same fate when Suarez weaved his way into the box for Barcelona's second goal . The Brazilian was left with his head in his hands after allowing Suarez a clean run at goal . Asked about Luiz's defending for Barcelona's third goal, the Sky Sports pundit said: 'Even if you're not 100 per cent fit you can't show that lack of intent. 'He's the last man on the pitch when Suarez picks the ball up and starts running at him. He realises he's the last man and the very last thing (you should do) when you're last man is jump in. You bide time for your team to get around you. 'He does what an eight year old who hasn't been coached does. He tries to win it by putting both of his feet together but when he does that he can't move anywhere. Suarez nutmegs him again.' Some of Luiz's best performances for PSG - and former club Chelsea - came when he was deployed in a central midfield role with less defensive responsibility, something Hoddle believes manager Laurent Blanc should consider from now on. Sky Sports pundit Glenn Hoddle described Luiz as a 'liability at the back' after PSG's defeat . Luiz defended like an 'eight-year-old who hasn't been coached' in this challenge, according to Hoddle . Suarez tucks home the first of his two goals against PSG after nutmegging Luiz with ease . He added: 'For me he's a liability at the back. He always has been.

Spieth held his nerve in Sunday's final round to keep control of the season's first major championship, matching Tiger Woods' record of an 18-under 270 and finishing four shots clear of the field. Speaking in Butler cabin as he prepared to receive his green jacket, the 21-year-old admitted that despite never giving up the lead, he was still a bag of nerves as he looked to hold off the attentions of two major champions in the form of Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose. Jordan Spieth has hailed the 'most incredible week' of his life after winning the Masters at Augusta . Spieth poses in his green jacket having held his nerve in Sunday's final round in a start-to-finish victory . 'It was very nerve-racking today,' Spieth said. 'I thought today might be a little easier than yesterday having played a round with the lead but it wasn't. I didn't sleep well last night, just got out here and got in a bit of rhythm and we were off. With two major champions behind I couldn't let up. 'It's the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport, this is a dream come true for me. To shoot some low rounds and to see some putts go in out here and to hear those roars, it was remarkable.' Spieth was greeted by his family at the 18th green, with his father telling him to do a lap of honour for all the patrons round the 18th green. And the Texan said that it was the moment of seeing his loved ones where it finally dawned on him that he was going to win. Spieth hugs his father Shawn at the 18th green, and he admitted that seeing his family made things sink in . Of seeing his family and friends, Spieth said: 'at that point knew that it was going to be a done deal' Spieth hugs his grandfather Bob but later said that even then the excitement of winning hadn't fully kicked in . 'I saw my family and friends right behind the green, and at that point knew that it was going to be a done deal,' he said. 'To be honest, it didn't kick in there, it still hasn't kicked in. I'm still kind of in shock a little bit. 'I'm sure it'll settle in maybe a little later but it was really great to share that experience with my family who weren't there any of the couple of times I had one so to be at this one was special.' ______ 'There's many players in the Tiger  era who have rued when Tiger won it by 15 or 12. Ernie Els, for example, could have won a bunch more major championships if it wasn't for one guy. 'Jordan seems to have that same quality right now and he's very comfortable playing with a lead.

Jimmy Anderson was presented with a special silver cap after reaching 100 Test matches for England . RICHIE REMEMBERED . In a week when cricket lost one of its most revered voices, respectful tributes were paid before play began in Antigua.

The players and officials also wore black armbands to show their respect. Both teams paid their respects to Richie Benaud before the start of play after he died last week . CANDID CAMERON . Dave Cameron — the West Indies Cricket Board president as opposed to the Prime Minister — said he needed to convince his team of the worth of playing for their country rather than playing for themselves. He told the BBC: ‘We have to help them understand that the team is the most important thing.’ HIGH AND KNIGHTY . There were some famous faces on show as the two ends of the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium were renamed in honour of Sir Curtly Ambrose and Sir Andy Roberts. Both were knighted at the ground in 2014 and Sir Curtly was joined by Sir Viv before play started. Though the power seems to have gone to Curtly’s head, judging by his unusual haircut...

What a shame that West Indies’ best batsman Chris Gayle chose to play in the IPL rather than for his country. Gayle hit 21 in a Royal Challengers Bangalore loss. It is a sad sign of the times that West Indies’ best would put a T20 competition before Test cricket. Money talks, of course, and Gayle has become very wealthy through Twenty20 cricket. It is certainly more lucrative than playing for West Indies.

Powering past Aston Villa was their 13th victory in 16 Premier League matches at Old Trafford and they have accumulated more points on their own territory, 40, than anyone else. No wonder after a period of irritation earlier in the season, the Stretford End are cheering regardless of whether United play quickly, slowly, pass back to goalkeeper David de Gea or boot it up to Marouane Fellaini .

CLICK HERE to view our brilliant Match Zone - including the move for Ander Herrera's opener in Manchester United's win . They remember losing seven home games under David Moyes last season. Two goals by Ander Herrera and a special one from Wayne Rooney were enough to sweep aside lowly opponents  and took United up to third place, a point ahead of neighbours Manchester City who play Crystal Palace on Monday before they are up next at the Theatre of Dreams. Even more importantly, Van Gaal's side are now eight points clear of Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool in fifth. It means his number one priority, restoring Champions League football to Old Trafford, has nearly been achieved. In terms of performance, it was something of the old, something of the new. United used width as their tradition demands with former Villa winger Ashley Young seeing a lot of the ball on the left. But there was a lot of patience and possession too. United had 72% of the ball without a lot to show for it until the reward came after 43 minutes. Daley Blind overlapped for the umpteenth time and on this occason his cutback to Herrera was perfect for the Spaniard to drill home. The second goal didn't arrive until 11 minutes from the end but was worth the wait. Angel Di Maria, on as a substitute, chipped the ball behind Rooney, but the England striker still found a way to score. He fully extended his left luminous green boot, brought the ball under control with his first touch and then spun 180 degrees to lash home his finish on the half-volley with his right. On such goals has the Theatre of Dreams acquired its reputation. But surprisingly there was still work to do for United because David de Gea let a Christian Benteke shot squirm through his body almost immediately aftewards.

It was only when Herrera added his second goal that van Gaal's men were totally safe though anything other than three points would have been a travesty on the balance of play. 'I wanted to come here and compete, and I thought we did that,' said Villa boss Tim Sherwood. 'But United have players who have been round the block, they know when to speed it up and slow it down. The goal just before half-time killed us.' FA Cup semi-finalists Villa could be in the bottom three when they face QPR at home on Tuesday night in a genuine relegation six-pointer. But they will be without a string of injured players including Alan Hutton. taken off at half-time yesterday with an ankle injury, Scott Sinclair, Ashley Westwood and Kieran Richardson. 'I've never known anything like it. Ridiculous,' said Sherwood. Van Gaal was simply relieved to get United's first game after the international break out the way. 'I was afraid before this match because we were playing against a very defensive organisaton. That is not easy to create chances and score goals,' he said.

Villa defended well in the first-half with Marcos Rojo going closest with a long-range shot that was tipped over by Brad Guzan. For long periods, Rooney cut an unhappy figure, beating the turf in frustration and arguing with referee Roger East after beind denied a penalty for Ciaran Clark's early challenge in the area where he seemed to grab the United striker by the back of the neck. If Rooney reflects on it later, maybe his over-dramatic fall to the ground persauded the official not to award a spot-kick. The deadlock was eventually broken when United passed and passed long enough for Blind to escape free down the left. The Dutchman picked out Herrera and he converted from 12 yards for his first goal at Old Trafford since September. When United couldn't get a second goal with Marouane Fellaini going closest, van Gaal sent on Di Maria and Falcao, combined value £103million.

I think not,' was the manager's retort. Surprisingly, David de Gea gave Villa brief hope to make the game 2-1.

'They're very solid defensively, they're not scared to put their foot or head in and they defend very well. 'Today they did that with a great performance by their goalkeeper.

Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full qualifying report. Host commentator . Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday’s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson . ‘Oh come on, guys’, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn’t matter as Rosberg can’t beat his lap. It is Hamilton’s pole. ______ Here we go… . Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We’ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903… but it is Hamilton up next. We’ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we’re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10… surely, Lewis Hamilton won’t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we’re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton’s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton… what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That’s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow’s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go… . Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the ‘rears are overheating’. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth… for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is fired up, but there’s no problem with the world champion’s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap… . Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week’s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday’s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: ‘I want a car. I’ve got a ticket.’ Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon’s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton’s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today’s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were.

With 18 broken bones, a broken nose, a ruptured kidney, a ruptured liver, missing teeth, and a fractured rib, Mack was unrecognisable as she fled her Las Vegas home on August 8, 2014. It was the climax, she claims, of an abusive on-off relationship with MMA fighter Jonathan Paul Koppenhaver, known professionally as War Machine. She is still undergoing reparative dental work - while fighting to see Koppenhaver convicted of attempted murder. The journey, she told ESPN, has been monumental. Scroll down for video .

Mack, 23, claims Koppenhaver, 33, became abusive four months into their one-year relationship, which started fast. When they met on a photo shoot set, she had pneumonia and he offered to look after her, bringing pizza to her hotel, she told ESPN. 'It was an amazing connection.

She said she believed, after the first attack, that it would never happen again. ______ A prosecutor asked the court to record Koppenhaver laughing and shaking his head as Mack said he sexually assaulted her . Koppenhaver has maintained his innocence and tweeted that he was also beaten by another man . Koppenhaver, who has legally changed his name to War Machine, will be tried this autumn . It wasn't until he went to the kitchen that she was able to flee to a neighbor's house, it is claimed. Koppenhaver maintains his innocence. Throughout court proceedings, he has dismissed the 26 charges against him as 'heart breaking', insisting he was a victim. He took to Twitter days after the alleged attack to say that he had gone to propose to Mack but 'ended up fighting for my life'. 'I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would be happily engaged. I don't know (why) I'm so cursed. One day truth will come out,' he wrote.

Taking to Twitter on Tuesday night, the 31-year-old Togo international expressed his gratitude at being able to play in the Premier League and labeled the division 'the best in the world.' Adebayor joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for £5million the following summer. ______ The striker's significantly more modest form since then, however, coupled with the meteoric rise of homegrown star Harry Kane, have left Adebayor little more than a bit-part in the Spurs machine. This season, he has made just 16 appearances in all competitions, scoring only twice and has been criticised for several underwhelming performances, in particular his showing against League One's Sheffield United in the Capital One Cup semi-final. Yet, the former Arsenal, Real Madrid and Manchester City hitman remains adamant that he will see out the remainder of his contract in north London. Adebayor's last Premier League goal for Spurs came during a 1-2 defeat by Newcastle back in October last year.

The Reds' 3-4-2-1 formation, implemented from mid-December, helped produce a 13-match unbeaten Barclays Premier League run which lifted them to within a win of breaking back into the Champions League qualification places. But despite receiving plaudits for the quality of their football, which at times appeared to be unplayable, flaws started to appear a month ago when they were held to a goalless draw by Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn in the FA Cup. Brendan Rodgers says his sides recent defeats are down to his players, not his tactics being susses . ______ However, Rodgers insists a drop-off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents. 'I don't think it's about being worked out. We didn't start well (against Arsenal), and it doesn't matter what system you are playing if that happens,' he said. 'In the last four games that we've played we haven't created as much, and that's more on ourselves. Liverpool have lost ground in the race for the Champions League places and will find it hard to recover . 'Of course you give opponents credit but every team will go into a game to defend well and work hard against you. 'Probably the Blackburn game when we drew 0-0 and the games following that we haven't created as much. 'That's something that we want to reinforce - the creativity for chances and hopefully taking those chances. 'It's a difficult system to play against, but it's one of a number of systems we've played here and played very well. Alexis Sanchez fires home Arsenal's third goal, as the Gunners thrashed Liverpool at the Emirates . 'It's my job to always look to find the solutions, that's what I've tried to do in the games when we didn't look like scoring, finding a way to win.' Blackburn, who host Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, will take heart from the Merseysiders' mini-slump at a crucial time of the season. For Rodgers and Liverpool though the cup now represents the only chance to save their season and that should guarantee a reaction at Ewood Park. 'It's important to have a game quickly when you lose,' added Rodgers. 'The group is very committed to winning this trophy but in order to do that you have to qualify and we know Blackburn will be a difficult game for us.

202375,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l3,4217,0,0,"It is not a match to decide the title, as has been the case in earlier seasons. But the Manchester derby this Sunday still holds great significance for both clubs, managers and, of course, supporters. City have won the last four contests between the sides, as well as the previous three at Old Trafford. A number of intriguing strands run through this coming clash and could be pulled apart on full time. Here Sportsmail assesses ten key questions and tries to provide some answers. Can Manuel Pellegrini survive a derby loss? The word is the Chilean’s future will be decided come May when the dust on a creaking season has settled. Defeat to cross-town rivals would push chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak closer to pressing the termination button though. It would leave City trailing United by four points and likely to finish fourth, needing to get past a qualifying round to reach to Champions League – the very minimum requirement. Manuel Pellegrini (centre) is a man under-pressure at City and a defeat to their rivals is unthinkable . Who needs the win more? To that end you would probably have to say City. A victory would inject some happiness into what seems a rather glum situation, and reignite ambitions to finish second, possible saving Pellegrini from the axe. United look set to finish in the top four regardless, the baseline attainment for this campaign to be judged satisfactory. But they will be desperate to alter that current ugly sequence against their noisy neighbours. United have never lost five in a row to City before. ______ Those uncertainties around the Dutchman would resurface just as swiftly with defeat of course. Louis van Gaal has had his critics this season but Manchester United's performances are proving them wrong . Should Vincent Kompany remain in the City side? It would be a big call for a game of such size, but the sense that City may be better off without their captain cannot be disregarded. These should be the 29-year-old’s peak years but injuries seem to have affected his body and mind. The Belgian is increasingly prone to errors of judgement. Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala do not provide the most robust competition but Kompany’s appearance in seven losses in 12 games speaks volumes. Mangala, on the bench against Crystal Palace, has experienced three losses in 24 matches all season. Vincent Kompany (left) has struggled for form this campaign and could lose his place for the derby . Where does this rank in English football’s biggest games? Manchester has become a powerhouse of English football through City’s ascent. The city has been home to the Premier League title for the past four seasons, oscillating between Old Trafford and the Etihad. That will not be the case this year but the rivalry still burns and allied to the global scale of these clubs the match ranks as high as any other, perhaps only beaten by Liverpool-United. Mario Balotelli (centre) produced one of the most iconic derby moments when he scored at Old Trafford . Who is the better player right now: Wayne Rooney or Sergio Aguero? No doubt Aguero is the better striker, his movement, angles for shooting, and goal-scoring record stands testament to that. But since being shifted to his preferred centre-forward role, Rooney is displaying form that would see him into any side. He has been approaching his all-action peak and scored seven goals in ten games for club and country, taking his overall season tally to 21. Aguero has 23 for the campaign, but has failed to find the net in his last six games, a run stretching back to February 24. At the moment you would have to go for Rooney. These two love the Manchester derby. Rooney holds the record for most all-time goals with 11, while Aguero has six in seven. Wayne Rooney (left) and Sergio Aguero are two of the best forwards in the current Premier League . How crucial might Michael Carrick be? His return to the United lineup in the fulcrum role in front of defence has lifted the side considerably. He has not enjoyed the best returns facing City in recent seasons – and in the corresponding fixture was asked to play centre-back as a first-half substitute – but will get more space in his deeper midfield role. It is unlikely Pellegrini will task anyone with marshalling Carrick, which is how he likes it. Michael Carrick (left) has become a key player for United over the years and is pivotal for Van Gaal . Will the real Yaya Toure show up? You would hope so. Yaya at the height of his powers in an awesome sight and could prove the difference. But those flashes have been all too fleeting this season. Now would be a good time to step up. Like Kompany, Yaya Toure's form is patchy but he scored a stunning goal against Crystal Palace on Monday . Will United solve the problem of Angel di Maria? The team looks balanced right now, with Ashley Young doing nothing to lose his place. United’s record signing has been coming on and providing assists, so Van Gaal is probably inclined to repeat the pattern. Ultimately, Di Maria must provide more, and will want to, but at this moment he should start on the bench. Why is kick-off at 4pm? Police saw no dangers of the late afternoon kick-off time on a Sunday, and have cited previous good behaviour between sets of supporters. As ever, television dictates the preference and the 4pm slot is prime for viewers. Angel di Maria hasn't quite settled in Manchester but recently has done well when coming off the bench .","Three points would begin to make their season look very decent indeed. Glenn Murray (right) tormented City at Selhurst Park as they dropped out of the Premier League title race . Would victory dispel any lingering doubts about Louis Van Gaal? Quite likely. Three successive wins on the bounce against opposition the stature of Tottenham, Liverpool and City would underline Van Gaal’s ability to rise to the big matches and suggest that, after a season of trial, error, and turnstile selections, the plan is coming together.","United wrap up fourth-place finish with a confidence before everyone else.

Fears of another season of domination from Mercedes were blown away by a shock, yet deserved victory for Sebastian Vettel last time out in Malaysia.

Spurs went into the game at Staines Town sitting sixth in the league but victory would have taken them joint top with the Red Devils, while the defending champions were only three points behind the north London outfit. Both teams will rue missed chances to claim all three points, with Spurs looking more likely to break the deadlock in the second half following a first period dominated by Chelsea. Ruben Loftus-Cheek played for Chelsea Under 21s having already starred in the Champions League this term . CHELSEA (4-3-3): Beeney, Dabo, Aina, Clarke-Salter, Dasilva, Colkett, Houghton, Loftus-Cheek (Boga 37), Brown, Solanke (Abraham 82), Mitchell (Musonda 67). Subs not used: Collins, Palmer. TOTTENHAM (4-3-3): McGee, Yedlin, McQueen, Amos, Lesniak, Carter-Vickers, McEvoy, Winks, Akindayini, Ceballos (Walker-Peters 69), Miller. Subs not used: Loft, Ross, Miles. Mitchell Beeney fumbled a low 20-yard attempt from Cristian Ceballos, but the Chelsea stopper was fortunate to see the ball roll through his legs and back off the post before gathering. Chelsea could have scored a dramatic winner in injury time but Luke McGee made a superb double stop to deny an Izzy Brown header, before quickly recovering to stop Tammy Abraham from close range on the follow up. The result saw Spurs climb to third behind United and Liverpool while the Blues remain eighth. ______ The Blues started talented prospect Ruben Loftus-Cheek, but the midfielder was forced off injured after just 37 minutes with a knock.

221656,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l4,4618,0,4,"Christian Benteke has revealed a secret. Despite what appeared cast-iron evidence to the contrary, he does not practise free-kicks. He has taken only a handful in his career. Yet with seven minutes to go in a game Aston Villa dared not lose, he stepped forward, pushing aside team-mates, to curl his dead-ball opportunity over the Queens Park Rangers wall and into the net. Precious point rescued. ‘I surprised myself!’ he says, laughing. ‘When I saw it, Charles N’Zogbia said, “I want to shoot”. ______ I have only taken one before for Villa, against Swansea, and I hit the post.’ What happens should a chance come from similar range against Liverpool? ‘I’ll take it. Sometimes you have to try.’ So speaks a striker of soaring confidence. Eight goals in his last six games, the latest a towering header to take all three points at Tottenham, Benteke is bang in form and relishing the prospect of an FA Cup semi-final. Sitting to discuss the match in a dressing room at Villa’s Bodymoor Heath training complex, he looks as if he would like to be on Wembley’s turf post-haste. He has been rejuvenated under Tim Sherwood, scoring a goal every 87 minutes since the new Villa manager took over. The unnerving thing for Liverpool is that he says he will get better. Benteke rises above Fererico Fazio to head the winning goal for Aston Villa against Tottenham on Saturday . Benteke points to the sky in celebration after scoring his eighth goal in six matches . Benteke is in the kind of form which could see Tim Sherwood's Villa escape from Premier League relegation . ‘I still think I can do more, in everything,’ he insists. ‘I can’t say I’m happy to be there now, I want to do more and more.’ That insatiable appetite is understandable after a disheartening year, starved first of football, then chances. It was April 3, 2014, when a loud crack was heard across Bodymoor’s training pitches signalling Benteke’s ruptured achilles. His World Cup dream was over. Parents Jean-Pierre and Marie-Claire cancelled their tickets to Brazil. Six months of rehabilitation followed before Benteke’s return last October. A red card on his third start against Tottenham kept him out for another brief period. There was a splendid goal at Crystal Palace, then another against Manchester United. A third came against Blackpool in the FA Cup third round. Dazzlingly good, but these strikes were isolated. Benteke never appeared his barnstorming self. His movement was limited, his impact negligible. Villa’s safety-first style was a significant factor. Often Benteke looked cut adrift up front. The nadir came when Paul Lambert dropped him to the bench for the visit of Chelsea in February. ‘It was frustrating because I knew I could do better,’ he says, reflecting on that moment. ‘Every time after the game I said to myself, “I can do better”. It was frustrating to play a game with no chances. But I am not that guy who is going to complain. I understood the situation.’ Sherwood’s impact has been immediate. Just as he did with Emmanuel Adebayor at Tottenham, he has taken a misfiring striker and recalibrated the shooting. Sherwood’s tactics are tailored to Benteke and his relentless positivity has awoken the inner beast. Benteke was forced to watch Belgium reach the quarter-final of the World Cup after rupturing his achilles . Benteke praised the impact of new manager Sherwood for playing a style that suits the striker's attributes . ‘He has given me a lot of freedom and he has said to the other lads to play maybe more direct with me,’ explains Benteke. ‘When a manager says that, you feel more important, more responsible. ‘The way that we play now is comfortable for me because I’m scoring and also for the team because I help the team.’ He is excited about his partnership with Gabby Agbonlahor. ‘He helps me destroy the defenders. With two we’re always better than one.’ Benteke is grateful to Lambert for bringing him to Villa from Genk in 2012 but acknowledges it was the correct call to sack the manager. ‘That’s a tough question,’ he pauses. ‘I will say yes because the confidence of the team was a little bit low and when the gaffer came he brought the confidence up.’ Benteke believes his fitness after such a long time out was an issue too but now he feels in peak condition. ‘I play like I used to before. I feel really good.’ Those summer weeks when he could only watch his nation’s World Cup adventure on TV are becoming a distant, if difficult, memory. Benteke is delighted with the partnership he has struck up with fellow striker Gabby Agbonlahor . The striker paid tribute to former manager Paul Lambert for signing him from Genk in 2012 . ‘It was tough,’ he says. ‘I worked hard for that opportunity. But that’s life. The manager Marc Wilmots said, “If you want, you can come with the lads.” But I didn’t. I came back to Belgium and my family helped get me through. My mum said, “You have to be thankful to God, it could have been worse”.’ Becoming a father to baby Jayden last September put things in perspective. ‘It was good, I forgot about my injury,’ he says, smiling. Doubts about his talent emerged during his troubles but he has faced down critics before. Three years ago Genk dismissed his Premier League credentials. ‘They said I wasn’t ready because the level between Belgium and England is really high and I should stay one more season. But I said, “No, I am confident, I want to go”. I don’t really listen to what people say. If I feel it, I just do it. But Benteke concedes that sacking Lambert was the correct decision after the lift Sherwood has given them . Chelsea midfielder and compatriot Eden Hazard tweeted his admiration for Benteke after his Spurs winner . ‘It was my dream to play in the best league. I was a fan of Arsenal.’ He insists he is not dreaming of scoring at Wembley. ‘I don’t want a dream, I want to do it.’ He is not that close to compatriot Simon Mignolet but is good friends with Marouane Fellaini and Eden Hazard. ‘I have known them since I was really young.’ Hazard tweeted his admiration following Benteke’s goal at Spurs. ‘He is my brother, like you say. For me, he deserves to be the Player of the Year.’ Benteke will consider what he deserves in the summer. Wolfsburg have been keeping tabs on him. ‘Since I came I have had a lot of pressure here,’ he says. ‘If I want to one day, after say four or five years, be with the big club, then it is pressure every time also.’ He ultimately wants European football. That will come for Villa by reaching the final, should Arsenal also qualify. ‘I think this is the beauty of the FA Cup, now everything is possible,’ he says.","But I said, “I want to take it”. Christian Benteke bends a free-kick over the QPR wall to rescue a point for Aston Villa last week . Benteke jumps for joy after sealing his hat-trick in the relegation battle with QPR at Villa Park .

And the Frenchman's reward for their good form was another Manager of the Month accolade to sit on his mantelpiece. Wenger has quite a few of the gongs now - 14 to be exact - but he has quite a long way to run until he matches the 27 monthly prizes of Sir Alex Ferguson. Arsene Wenger is March's winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award - his 14th accolade .

The legendary Manchester United manager was the inaugural winner of the Manager of the Month award when it was introduced in August 1993, at the start of the Premier League's second season. With United winning no fewer than 12 Premier League titles during that time, it comes as little surprise to see the Scot top of the list. In the 1999-2000 campaign, he won it in August, March and April as United romped to the title by 18 points and exerted a similar dominance in 2006-2007, claiming the prize in August, October and February. The last of Ferguson's 27 awards came in October 2012, not long before he announced his retirement. A Manchester United double as Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona celebrate their awards in 1996 . Ferguson won 27 monthly prizes in all, including this one for February 1997 . Ferguson and Wayne Rooney were celebrating in February 2005 as they claimed the monthly prizes . Wenger first got his hands on the award in March 1998 and also won it the following month as Arsenal claimed the Double of Premier League and FA Cup in his first full campaign. Before this month's win, Wenger had last been recognised in September 2013 as his team made a positive start in a campaign that would ultimately see them finish fourth. He may have struggled to fill Ferguson's shoes at Old Trafford, but David Moyes won this accolade 10 times when in charge of Everton. Harry Redknapp and Martin O'Neill have the monthly award listed eight times on their CVs, while Bobby Robson, Rafa Benitez and Sam Allardyce both have six. Jose Mourinho may have led Chelsea to two Premier League titles but his tally of three is not as many as the four won by Joe Kinnear during his days as Wimbledon manager. 27 - Manchester United . 14 - Arsenal, Liverpool . 13 - Newcastle United . 12 - Everton . 11 - Chelsea . 9 - Manchester City, Southampton . 8 - Tottenham Hotspur . 7 - Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers . 6 - Blackburn Rovers . 5 - Leeds United, West Ham United . 4 - Leicester City, Wimbledon . 3 - Charlton Athletic, Coventry City, Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Reading, Sheffield Wednesday, Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion, Wigan Athletic . 2 - Fulham, Swansea City . 1 - Birmingham City, Crystal Palace, Derby County, Hull City, Ipswich Town, Norwich City, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers .

Among the state of California's approximately 162,000 inmates, the most dangerous serve their time in Level IV maximum-security facilities where it is estimated as much as 97 per cent are gang affiliated. The gangs rule life behind the cement walls the same way as out on the streets, but for those who choose to leave the criminal families behind, the California Department of Corrections offers a chance at a different way of living on the inside. New order: Jeffrey Burkes (ex-Black Guerilla Family), Rubin Davis(ex-Mexican Mafia-Southern California), Norman Wayne Willhoite (ex-Aryan Brotherhood) and Dimas Deleon(ex-Nuestra Familia-Northern California), have spent collectively 55 years hating one another. In the past, standing next to each other would have meant kill or be killed. Now, all four  reside in a Sensitive Needs Housing Unit . New unit: A former member of an Aryan Brotherhood gang walks through the prison yard in the Sensitive Needs Housing Facility at the California Department of Corrections, a section of the prison where gang behaviour is banned . Mixing it up: Inmates of different races and gang backgrounds play basketball together in the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit yard under the supervision of correctional officers in stark contrast to the segregation that generally governs prison life . Since 1999, the CDC has seen a dramatic increase in requests from inmates seeking special protection for dropping out of prison gangs, and as a result has set up several Sensitive Needs Housing Units. A Sensitive Needs Housing Unit can be found inside Level IV maximum-security facilities and is set to protect former members from the gangs, some of the more prominent being the Black Guerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood and rival hispanic gangs Nuestra Familia from Northern California and the Mexican Mafia from the south. The exclusive units inside Sensitive Needs Housing provide a safer environment, free from gang activity, and the transition out of gang membership is dramatic. As these images show, inmates of different races and gang affiliations mix during their daily exercise and in the cafeteria during lunch. Prisoners who would previously have killed each other on sight due to their race or gang, now jokily tackle each other during a friendly basketball game on the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit's court. Building bridges: An ex-Mexican Mafia (southern California) gang member exercises with  former members of the Nuestra Familia (northern California) in the the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit. Historically, members of these two rival gangs would have killed each other on sight . The other side of things: Prisoners who still remain in the 'normal' parts of the prison, outside the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit, refuse to exercise simultaneously, inmates alternate their workout routines until members of other gangs race have finished . ______ He explains how, in his world he was the self-proclaimed God; his word determined who lived or died. After spending almost 16 years in solitary confinement, he chose to drop out and now resides in a Sensitive Needs Housing Unit . Dining together: Inmates share meals in a cafeteria setting, which is a freedom allowed in Sensitive Needs Housing Units . One of them is Dimas 'Diablo' Deleon, formerly one of the most feared enforcers for the Nuestra Familia. In his world, he was the self-proclaimed God - his word determined who lived or died. After spending almost 16 years in solitary confinement for his gang leadership, he says lost respect for the collective decision-making and chose to drop out. He now resides in the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit, where corrections officers, as well as inmates, report a considerable reduction in racial violence and segregation. Although inmates of the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit are no longer gang affiliated or validated, the fact remains that they are some of the most hardened and dangerous men behind bars. Some racial segregation is still self-imposed by the inmates, and they are routinely stripped and undergo full-body cavity searches for weapons and narcotics. A gang dropout in the Sensitive Needs Housing Facility participates in a 'joint venture program,' a collaboration between the prison and a private sector company. Outside of Sensitive Needs Housing, inmates with jobs earn 20 cents an hour. Those who have renounced gang membership have the opportunity to work for the federal minimum wage. The money he earns is distributed among his family, the family of the man he murdered, personal savings, and an inmates' fund . Break with tradition: Free of body shackles, inmates in a Sensitive Needs Housing Unit walk to the prison yard for their daily exercise . Still issues: Several packets of black tar heroin, a razor blade, a homemade syringe, and a cooking spoon were wrapped in artwork. The contraband was probably smuggled into the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit in the anal cavity of a visitor and passed to an inmate . For those living outside the Sensitive Needs Housing Unit, old rules apply. Every gang has a hierarchy, and members and affiliates follow orders from the leaders who are deemed 'validated' by outside powers. Only the most feared and brutally confident inmates within a Level IV prison reach validation status. Leaders of gang hierarchy manage daily operations such as murders, assaults and narcotic trafficking inside the prison. With racial tensions running high at Level IV facilities, validated gang members and other residents of Administrative Segregation Housing Unit spend their exercise time in 15ftx7ft cages, called 'dog runs.' Even though inmates are segregated and separated by the cages, they refuse to exercise simultaneously. Instead, inmates alternate their workout routines, waiting until members of rival gangs have finished. Two worlds - one prison: Handcuffs are removed from an inmate housed in a vertical cage in the Administration Segregation Unit in preparation for a full cavity search at the Calipatria State Prison, left, and right; an inmate receives a haircut in a Sensitive Needs Housing Unit . Strict rules: Until he passes three bowel movements, this inmate, suspected of hiding a weapon or drugs in his anal cavity, is confined in a special Administration Segregation holding cell containing nothing more than a bare mattress in Calipatria State Prison .

Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool’s offer of close to £100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £40million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with £40million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — Gareth Bale even — requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool’s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike Tottenham’s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player’s agent for his role in the England international’s ongoing contract saga — and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers’ criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as ‘Uncle Aidy’. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has ‘more kids than caps’ when he admits to one daughter — he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training — but denies a second child. But Sterling’s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. ‘As a young kid I had anger issues,’ Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up ‘in prison’ if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was ‘amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker’. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling’s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose ‘mentality’ was ‘his strongest attribute’. He also described him as ‘a coach’s dream’. Gallen also praised Sterling’s mother — Nadine is a nurse — for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his ‘house parents’. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling’s value to Liverpool is earning roughly £6m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; £35,000-a-week compared with £150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling’s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of £100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club’s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song ‘from the Kop’. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his ‘agent is a ****’. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don’t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don’t take the dispute into the public arena if it’s not a pay rise you’re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward’s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. ______ Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?",He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a ‘beautiful house’ back in Jamaica.,The blank: Nobody,0.8077263832,0.7940969467,0.8008536696,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The pair mischievously claimed that Donegal's seaside town was their destination of choice for a post-Olympic break following their respective bronze medal wins at London 2012, but they have certainly travelled far and wide during the current Olympiad. Barnes may have already been well known in Ireland prior to their achievements in London, but taking up his part in a charming double act with Conlan only endeared him further to a nation that unfortunately only flirts with the amateur version of the sport every four years before medallists appear on homecoming flights. Conlan (leff) lands a right jab on Matthew Martin during his bantamweight bout in Glasgow in 2014 . The reality of making that happen is far more complex, of course, and the efforts of Barnes and Conlan to make it to Rio 2016 are unprecedented. On Saturday night, the Belfast boys are potentially both one win away from qualifying for next summer's Olympic Games, with Barnes needing to ensure victory while Conlan must do likewise and depend on another result elsewhere. Their mission takes them to Maiquetia, northern Venezuela, where they will take on native opposition, the latest stop on the road-trip that is the World Series of Boxing (WSB) — a part of the convoluted new structure that once was 'amateur' boxing. WSB boxers are part of a franchise team, fighting individually over five three-minute rounds in a pro-style format. Barnes and Conlan box for the Italia Thunder team, but the sights and sounds of Milan and Rome were not what drew them to the competition. In fact, they have fought only three of their six bouts so far in Italy and while most WSB fighters receive payment, the Irish pair signed up with Olympic qualification as their sole motivation. Upon their return to Belfast after Saturday night's fight, they will have covered a distance of over 34,000 miles over the course of their various round trips. That is the equivalent of three trips from Dublin to Melbourne. They will have each fought seven fights in 13 weeks and, as of today, Barnes has boxed 29 rounds in 12 weeks to Conlan's 28. They are burnt out, peeved off and ready for rest — but only once their mission is complete Saturday night. Barnes is one victory away from qualifying for 2016 summer games in Rio . 'I just feel tired, I'm sick of it,' laments a worn-out Barnes, who is an undefeated 6-0. 'To fight every fortnight, travelling around the world, it's doing my head clean in.

I was very, very close. I think I was in Heathrow and I was going to get a plane back to Belfast. 'If I didn't qualify for the Olympics through this WSB, I'd have nothing to do with it. I've been training from November right through and then I'd need to go to the Europeans [Games] in June — I couldn't do that, like. ______ 'I'll not even be able to drink water, never mind a beer to relax, because I'll be making weight.' If he sounds like a touch grouchy, it is understandable. While their fixture list has included destinations as culturally and geographically diverse as Guba in Azerbaijan, Palermo, Poland's Konin, Almaty in Kazakhstan, Rome, Milan and now Maiquetia, the two-time Olympic medallist explains that they do not get to soak up the glamorous aspects of the cities. 'Far from it,' says Barnes. 'You go away and you have to go to the worst areas, there's nothing extravagant about it. It's not five star — it's one-and-a-half star. 'You can't really see too much because we're only there for a short period of time and when we get there we're training to make the weight… We're home the next day [after the fight] in the early hours. So we're more or less in and out.' Michael Conlan (left) and Paddy Barnes sport their bronze medals following their success at London 2012 . Adding to Barnes' stress is his constant struggle to make the 49kg light-flyweight limit. The 28-year-old has been boxing in the same weight division for 12 years and tales of his notoriously cranky pre-weigh-in demeanour are common, with Conlan witnessing the battle first hand as his regular room-mate. 'It does make it easier because we're mates outside boxing,' says Barnes of the benefits of being signed up to the same team as his pugilist pal. 'We're travelling together and fighting together so it is good, I'd rather that then going away on my own because I think I'd pack it in. It's too much of a strain. 'But when we're away, I barely talk to him because he knows I'm making weight!' Conlan, the laidback member of the double act, takes a far more carefree approach to travel. 'Getting on a plane doesn't bother me, if you're going to die on a plane, you're going to die,' laughs Conlan. 'A lot of the flights I try and sleep through so I'll be waking up in their [local] time.' The 23-year-old recently became a father, with his young daughter just four weeks old, while Barnes is also a father to a daughter of 11 months. The pair have also stayed neck and neck in terms of international achievements since Conlan emerged on the senior scene in 2011 and the younger member of the duo is also appreciative of his friend's presence on WSB duty. 'It's good for both of us because I know when I'm training with him, we're both training hard and pushing each other,' says Conlan. 'Everything we've done up until this WSB since 2012 has been the exact same — Olympic bronze, European silver, Commonwealth gold. The fact that this WSB has messed me up a bit is a bit unfortunate but we're still going well,' adds Conlan, who is in qualification limbo after two disputed 'away' points decisions, increasing the temptation to turn pro . 'Winning [tonight] isn't going to be a problem, I'm just waiting on other results. It's a bit of a sickener, but it has to be done at the end of the day. I have to get in there and do what I have to do and win, do my part of the job.' 'I'll try not to make any dramatic decisions after the fight if it goes against me, but I have a sharp tongue at times and say stupid things,' says Conlan. 'Hopefully it all works out. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.' For Barnes, he maintains: 'The Olympic Games is what it's all about, it's every amateur boxer's dream and if I qualify, I'll be honoured to say I qualified for my third Olympic Games.'","I physically couldn't do that, it'd be impossible.' In addition to hand injuries, which have severely limited his training, Barnes has another battle he must overcome as he bids to become the first Irish boxer ever to reach a third Olympic Games. 'I hate flying, I just hate it, it depresses me even thinking about it. I can't even sleep, I'm that scared. I can't sleep, can't watch films, can't read books, I'm just too panicky, too nervous.","The blank denoted by ""conlan (left)"" in the passage represents a paragraph with three sentences.",0.8149651289,0.8048726916,0.8098874688,0.0594059406,0.0,0.0594059406,0.0594059406

Hardaker was at the centre of a police assault probe into an attack on a 22-year-old man at student flats in Leeds, but was not charged with any offence. Leeds issued a lengthy statement outlining Hardaker's punishment, which will also see him forfeit one month's salary to be donated to a local charity and do up to 20 hours a week of voluntary work for the club's foundation for the duration of his contract. Hardaker and team-mate Elliot Minchella both paid £200 in compensation and wrote a letter of apology to a 22-year-old man following a police investigation but Leeds said Hardaker's punishment is far stronger 'given his previous misconduct'. Leeds Rhinos have sent full back Zak Hardaker (centre with the ball) on an anger management course . The one-cap England international received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year and was also fined by England for breaching team discipline during the 2013 World Cup. The statement from Leeds read: 'The club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realised that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him.' It went on: 'We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. 'We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.' Minchella received a written warning and a fine of 50 per cent of his monthly salary, while team-mates Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley were fined and issued verbal warnings. Police said the student received two black eyes and a bruised neck during the incident. Hardaker received a five-match ban and a fine for a homophobic comment made last year . Leeds Rhinos have today issued the following statement relating to an incident which happened in the city earlier this year that was brought into the public spotlight: . 'The Leeds Rhinos Players Code of Conduct prohibits players from visiting licensed premises after midnight without prior permission from me or the Head Coach. Our investigation has revealed this regulation was breached by five players on a midweek evening before the start of this season. ______ It has been an exhaustive process and we are always disappointed when players fall below the standards we expect of them and let everyone else down. The players themselves are embarrassed and very apologetic and I am sure it has been a lesson learned for all involved. 'Rob Mulhern, Josh Walters and Ash Handley have each received a fine and a verbal warning. Elliot Minchella has received a written warning and a fine of 50% of his monthly salary. 'With regard to Zak Hardaker, the club has accepted his apology for his actions, however, given his previous misconduct, Zak has realized that it is his actions rather than his words that must now show his intentions to put these events behind him. Therefore, we have agreed the following actions: . 1) Zak will forfeit one months salary and this will be donated to support a local charity project . 2) He will enroll on a course for anger management . 3) Zak will work as a volunteer for up to 20 hours a week for the duration of his Rhinos contract to assist the Leeds Rhinos Foundation and Marketing Department. 'Zak is full of passion and enthusiasm and has many qualities that are to be admired in a young player but a small part of him has led to problems and this has to be addressed, not only for the image of the game but most importantly for Zak’s own well being and his ability to fulfil his potential. We have passed the point of telling him what he has to do, however, for the first time Zak has admitted to us and, more importantly to himself, that he has an issue with aspects of his lifestyle which he wants to improve. We have listened to what he has committed to do for himself and we will support him.'","Furthermore Zak Hardaker and Elliot Minchella were involved in an incident at a student accommodation building, which led to a police investigation and a written apology from both players to a student and a £200 compensation payment from Hardaker and Minchella.

The First Utility Super League leaders were without their inspirational captain, who this week announced he is to switch codes at the end of 2015, for the third successive game on Good Friday, but they continue to thrive without him. The Rhinos had beaten Wigan and Catalans Dragons in Sinfield's absence and added Castleford to that list thanks to an excellent team performance, with young winger Ash Handley particularly impressive up against the formidable Justin Carney. Leeds Rhino's Adam Cuthbertson celebrates a try with Jamie Peacock (left) Ryan Hall was sent to the sin-bin for the first time in his career in a frenetic opening but Castleford failed to take advantage and it was the Rhinos who struck first as Joel Moon scored his first try of the season. Hall made amends by extending Leeds' lead and Stevie Ward's converted try cancelled out Michael Shenton's effort to give the Rhinos a 16-6 half-time lead. There were chances aplenty at the start of the second period but brilliant defence by both sides meant there was no further addition to the score until the 63rd minute, when Hall completed his double. Adam Cuthbertson then crossed for a try his performance deserved and despite Shenton's late second, Leeds extended their unbeaten run against the Tigers to six matches. Leeds Rhino's Joel Moon scores the first try for his side during their victory . Brian McDermott warned the Rhinos to be wary of a fast start by Castleford and although it was Leeds who came out of the blocks quickest, the Tigers were handed an early advantage when Hall was sent to the sin-bin for a professional foul. Leeds youth product Luke Gale failed to exploit the gap in the Rhinos' left side when his pass to James Clare from the resultant penalty floated forwards. Liam Sutcliffe was next to fluff his lines as he spilled the ball reaching for the tryline, but Leeds did not have to wait much longer for their first try of the afternoon. The Rhinos rolled downfield after a knock-on by Scott Moore, and Danny McGuire exchanged passes with Brad Singleton before putting Moon through a hole to score. Hall had returned to the field just in time to congratulate his team-mate and he was celebrating a try of his own soon after. Leeds Rhino's Ryan Hall goes over the line for their third try of the clash . McGuire was hauled down just short of the line after Moon's break but Cuthbertson kept his cool on the next play to give Hall an easy finish in the corner. Sutcliffe landed the touchline conversion to give Leeds a 10-0 lead. The Rhinos went in search of a crucial third try - with Brett Delaney just held up over the line - but their lead was cut to four points when Shenton reacted quickest to Liam Finn's dab through and Gale kicked a goal from out wide. The momentum was suddenly with Castleford as they probed for another try to level up the contest, but such was its nature that Leeds re-established their 10-point lead. ______ Carney then turned try-saver when he stopped Zak Hardaker finishing off a Rhinos break and Leeds were denied by more impressive Castleford defence as Singleton was held up. The visitors finally broke through for a fourth time when McGuire spotted his side had numbers on the left and found Moon, who gave Hall another simple task in the corner. Australian forward Cuthbertson continued his fine first season in England with a powerful finish, but the Tigers had the last word as Shenton exchanged passes with Carney to score.","Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield sat out during the week he announced he was switching codes . Kallum Watkins played a big part in taking the Rhinos close to the Tigers' line and Sutcliffe's neat reverse kick sat up nicely for Ward to get downward pressure on the ball. Good defence by Sutcliffe denied Shenton his second try at the start of the second half before Cuthbertson was held up over the line at the other end. The excitement continued as Carney picked up a loose Leeds pass well inside his own half and raced clear seemingly destined to score, only for McGuire to slow him down with an ankle tap before Handley hauled him down.

Following the Gunners' 1-0 win against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, the Colombia international took his tally to 11 wins from 12 games since he displaced Wojciech Szczesny as No 1 in January. Ospina has kept six clean sheets in those 12 games with his only defeat coming against Tottenham in the north London derby on February 7 to boast an impressive win percentage. But who else makes the top 10? Ospina has the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances .

Manchester United's 19-year-old striker James Wilson has only failed to be on the winning side three times from his 13 appearances putting him seventh on the list, while former Arsenal defender Igor Stepanovs' 76.5 per cent is enough to put him eighth. Nacho Monreal, currently preferred to Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal left back, has won 43 games from his 57 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side. United defender Paddy McNair sneaks into the top 10 with 75 per cent having featured 12 times under Louis van Gaal this season, winning nine. ______ Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015.

Rodgers knows he must work harder to sell Anfield as a destination for ambitious players without the lure of a Champions League campaign — and to keep those who might be hankering after a move, such as Raheem Sterling. ‘It makes it difficult, there’s no doubt about that,’ said the Liverpool manager. ‘Most players want to be in the Champions League. They want to play at the top level of the game and if you’re not in the Champions League it makes it difficult for you. We know that. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has conceded defeat in his quest for the top four . Liverpool players leave the pitch after the 4-1 defeat against Arsenal on Saturday afternoon . Arsenal have won 17 of their 20 games since Christmas in all competitions. That includes 12 Premier League wins, one in the Champions League and four FA Cup victories. ‘It’s going to be a little like this until we become more stable. We’ve got young players who are growing, getting more experience and then hopefully there will be a period where we qualify again. We want to be in the Champions League. That’s important and it is key for us. ‘It’s highly unlikely this year. But Liverpool is a great club. I said that before I came into it. It’s a phenomenal club that players want to play for.’ Rodgers starts the week seven points adrift of the Champions League places with fourth-placed Manchester City playing tonight at Crystal Palace. Successive defeats against direct rivals Manchester United and Arsenal have seen him write off his top-four hopes. ‘I’m a realist,’ said the Liverpool boss. ‘We needed to take something from Arsenal. If we’d done that then our chances would have been greater. I wouldn’t expect the others to slip up, particularly Arsenal or Manchester United. I don’t expect them to do that. Add to that, the sort of growing number we’ve got unavailable I think it will make it very, very difficult with only seven games to go.’ Rodgers will instead prioritise the FA Cup. ______ Centre halves Emre Can and Martin Skrtel are suspended, which will not help solve the defensive shambles which unfolded at the Emirates Stadium. Steven Gerrard is also banned after being sent off against United. Mario Balotelli ruled himself out of the 4-1 defeat at Arsenal, complaining of an unspecified knee injury after training on the eve of the game, while Daniel Sturridge played and did not look confident about his own fitness after pulling out of England duty with a hip injury. After selling Luis Suarez last summer and starting the campaign poorly, Liverpool recovered, only to lose their impetus after beating Manchester City a month ago. ‘We always felt this year was going to be difficult, that was the reality of it,’ said Rodgers. ‘Our run last year nearly brought us the title. We lost a world-class player and lots of other developments happened within the club. Mario Balotelli (left) ruled himself out of the defeat after complaining of an unspecified knee injury . Rodgers cites losing a 'world-class player' like Luis Suarez (right) has made things difficult for Liverpool . ‘But it’s frustrating that we got ourselves in a position over the last three months, very close, to then come up short in the past two games. I look at Arsenal and their bench, the players, the world-class players on the field with big talent and it shows the continual work we have to do. ‘We don’t give up. We will fight right to the end. Obviously the FA Cup is a priority for us. But there’s been lots of positives from it, looking at players’ development, seeing players grow, it’s been good. ‘And, as a manager not that long in the game, it’s been great for me up to this point, learning about the dynamics of everything. We can still fight and we have an obligation to represent the supporters in the last seven games, and in the FA Cup, to finish as well as we can.’ Liverpool will meet Arsenal again at Wembley in the FA Cup final, if it all goes to form, and Arsene Wenger’s team are finishing the season in irresistible form. The Arsenal players celebrate Hector Bellerin's goal during the 4-1 victory on Saturday . They have won 17 of 20 games in all competitions since Christmas, a sequence spoiled by the aberration in the first leg against Monaco in the Champions League. There are grounds for optimism at the Emirates but Wenger has good vibes about the future. ‘We have a good mentality and good cohesion in the team,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘There is something happening. That shows you that they are ready to fight for each other. You can see that. 'You can’t cheat on that. People smell that.That of course is a good basis, and defensively we are getting better. I think you also have to give credit to players who get less, such as Francis Coquelin. ‘But I am old enough to know that things are never as comfortable as they look. Let’s judge at the end of the season. ‘We’re on a good run and it will be down to how we can maintain that focus and urgency.’",It is nine years since Liverpool won the trophy but indiscipline is eating away at his options ahead of Wednesday’s quarter-final replay against Blackburn.

He said: 'I was very pleased because the fans are pleased and we are playing for them. The fans have not always had a good time because it started very bad.

The club maintain the matter will be dealt with internally but he is not going to be fined. Sterling enraged Liverpool after saying in a BBC interview that he was ‘flattered’ to be linked with Arsenal. It is understood, however, that Arsenal have gone cold on Sterling, who scored in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday. All talks about his future have been put on hold until the end of the campaign but Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s chief executive, issued a strong line yesterday, insisting that Sterling — who has turned down a contract in the region of £100,000 per week — would be at Anfield for a ‘long time’. Ayre said: ‘Raheem’s agent has asked that we park all discussions regarding his future until the summer. We respect that. Raheem is a Liverpool player and has two years left on his contract. We expect Raheem Sterling to be here for a long time.’ It appears that Sterling and Ibe each have a shisha pipe and are also drinking Fanta . Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Shisha pipes are used to smoke fruit-flavoured tobacco, which is burned on hot coals, through a long tube. They are commonly used in the Middle East. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes, which calls into question the professionalism of any athlete using the pipe. The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: ‘Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was pictured on a social media site with the picture captioned ‘1 down 3 to go’, suggesting he did not just take a single drag on the pipe.

But the lawyer also argued that Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, masterminded the attack and enlisted his then-19-year-old brother to help. On April 19, 2013, Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat and had written notes inside suggesting the bombing was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries . Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as full partners in a plan to retaliate against the US for its wars in Muslim countries. The court will likely meet early next week to resume the penalty phase.

Yarde excelled in Saturday's roller-coaster Aviva Premiership victory over Gloucester, scoring the crucial try in the 70th minute at The Stoop. The 22-year-old wing won the last of his seven caps as a replacement last autumn, but was overlooked by England throughout the RBS 6 Nations. Harlequins winger Charlie Walker crosses for his side's first try at the Stoop . ‘We’ve had a difficult year, but anyone who has watched him will know he’s been absolutely outstanding. When we get back to winning he will get recognition again,’ O'Shea said. ______ Yarde seized the initiative for the London club and full-back Ollie Lindsay-Hague appeared to have sealed the victory, only for Dan Robson's try with a minute left to give Gloucester a faint glimmer of hope until they aimlessly kicked the ball away in the last act of the game. The opening 10 minutes were dominated by Gloucester's scrum, yet it was Quins who opened the scoring when outside centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma jinked into space before sending Charlie Walker over. Walker's try was the result of a clinical counter attack, but the 2012 Premiership champions were immediately back under pressure once play resumed with their set-piece targeted once more, conceding a penalty that Greig Laidlaw sent between the uprights. Gloucester No 8 Gareth Evans is hit hard by Quins flanker Jack Clifford . Laidlaw and Evans exchanged penalties and just as Quins began to attack with greater frequency, yet another retreating scrum gave Gloucester the platform to race into a 31st minute lead. Hook broke the gainline with a large dummy - his second of the afternoon - and found Bill Meakes in support, with the outside centre showing strength to force his way over from 10 yards out. Gloucester's set-piece dominance was rewarded when Pearce sent Marler to the sin bin, but they were unable to turn a push late in the first half into points. A big step and outside-break from full-back Lindsay-Hague created a half-chance for Yarde moments after the interval, but the England wing was well tackled. Harry Sloan tries to evade the clutches of Cherry and Whites flanker Sione Kalamafoni . It was then Gloucester's turn to find space through Jonny May down the right wing only for Sharples to drop what should have been a try scoring pass. Two attacking scrums later, however, and Sharples dived over after Meakes had spotted the overlap caused by Quins being sucked into the one-sided forward exchanges. Evans' boot whittled down the deficit to one point but as the match entered the final quarter number eight Jack Clifford was shown a yellow card for a shoulder challenge on Sharples and Laidlaw rifled over the ensuing penalty. Gloucester scrum half Dan Robson crosses the Quins whitewash for a late score . Despite being a man down, Quins almost scored with two successive rolling mauls and on both occasions Gloucester saw a player sin-binned - replacement lock Ross Moriarty for bringing down the first drive and Sharples for a deliberate knock on. On the third line-out catch and drive they succeeded, with Yarde touching down as the game entered the final 10 minutes. Lindsay-Hague and replacement scrum-half Robson then swapped late tries to bring the game to a dramatic if scrappy conclusion.","Quins spent most of an uninspiring mid-table clash feeding off scraps due to the overwhelming superiority of the visiting scrum, only to produce the key drive in the 70th minute that was finished by Marland Yarde. As half time drew close, referee Luke Pearce had finally lost patience with Harlequins set-piece frailty and pointed the finger at Joe Marler by sending the club captain to the sin-bin. Gloucester only entered the interval 13-11 ahead - a poor return given their ascendency - and then moved 18-11 clear through a Charlie Sharples try with half an hour remaining to suggest their eighth win of the season was imminent. Quins centre Aseli Tikoirotuma puts in a strong fend on Gloucester lock James Hudson .

'No one has got any idea whether Kevin Pietersen will play for England again. 'The only people that know that are those who are currently picking the England side. 'At the moment he's not being considered, because he hasn't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months.' Pietersen chills out against the fence as Oxford MCCU bat on Monday . Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors . Hussain is impressed that Pietersen has already proved he is serious about a recall, and he is adamant the England and Wales Cricket Board must 'watch out' for him. 'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.' Hussain senses Pietersen will not be easily deterred, unless England spell out that they do not want him. 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. 'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.' Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday . Pietersen fielding on Monday afternoon as the 34-year-old makes his county cricket return . He hopes Pietersen can boost Surrey's championship promotion prospects, and was encouraged by his comeback. 'It was a very good innings,' Stewart added. ______ 'Will he play for England? We don't know. All we're going to do is enjoy having Kevin around, scoring as many runs as he can. 'Next game, next innings, is the next most important one.' Pietersen had a quieter second day back in his whites. He fielded at mid-off and slip as Surrey's hosts dug in after resuming on 28 for four. Jack McIver top-scored with 83, hitting 11 fours and a six, in the students' 224 all out. Chris Tremlett, another England Test player, took five for 30. Surrey reshuffled their batting order in the second innings, and Pietersen was left to watch on as they reached 182 for three - Zafar Ansari making 53 towards a lead of 378 entering Tuesday's final day.","'He had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up, letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is, which we all know but we just haven't seen it because he's only played 20-over cricket.

106027,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,2209,1,5,"Wisden, the cricket bible, has launched a stinging attack on English cricket and says that the national team have lost touch with the game's public. Editor Lawrence Booth, also a respected cricket writer with Sportsmail, uses his notes to take England to task after a tumultuous year spent trying to recover from the bitter fall-out of losing the last Ashes series 5-0. English cricket, says Booth in the 152nd edition of the fabled Almanack, which is published on Wednesday, 'repeatedly lost touch with the basic idea that the national team belongs to us all'. Wisden editor Lawrence Booth has launched a stinging attack on the ECB's handling of Kevin Pietersen . The star batsman will ply his trade for Surrey in a bid to reclaim his spot in the England Test team . And he continues: 'A few wins might have deflected attention from a charge sheet that would include the mishandling of the Kevin Pietersen affair, worrying Test attendances outside London, a head in the sand attitude to the one-day team and - not yet a decade after the 2005 Ashes had presented English cricket with a golden chance to attract a new generation to the sport – a fall in the number of recreational players. 'Starting with the drubbing in Australia, England lost eight full series out of all across the formats in 2014, to say nothing of their defeat by the Netherlands at the World Twenty20. In all, they lost 28 games. Only once had this been surpassed in a calendar year by one of the eight major teams – the dysfunctional 2010 Pakistanis. 'National selector James Whitaker had called Cook ""our exceptional leader""; Paul Downton, the ECB's new managing director, hailed Peter Moores as the ""outstanding coach of his generation"". It was a nexus of self-preservation yet, as the wagons circled, the wheels kept threatening to fall off.' The Wisden editor is just as scathing about England's decision to sack Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the drink of what turned out to be the most disastrous World Cup in England's history. Peter Moores presided over a disastrous World Cup but was labelled 'the outstanding coach of his generation' by the ECB's new managing director Paul Downton . The beleaguered Alastair Cook was stripped of the one-day captaincy before the World Cup debacle . 'To leave the sacking of Cook so late made little sense,' says Booth. 'Had he stepped down in August after the 3-1 Test win over India he could have done so with his post-Ashes reputation partly restored. This would have allowed him to gather strength for the ludicrous run of 17 Tests in less than 10 months, starting in Great Optimism in Antigua in April 2015 and ending in Near Exhaustion in South Africa in January 2016. (As someone pointed out, 17 Tests are almost a third of Don Bradman's career.) 'Trouble was, Cook had become more than just a cricketer: cast by his employers in the role of latter-day saint to Pietersen's fallen angel, he was now an article of faith. Giles Clarke (the ECB chairman) even suggested the Cooks were ""very much the sort of people we want the England captain and his family to be"" which was all well and good but couldn't stop him edging behind. Downton, Whitaker and Moores were all bound up with his fate. Cook had to succeed, as much for others as himself. It was an intolerable position. 'England overplayed their hand. The Test win over a supine India did not mean Cook would effect a similar transformation of the one-day side. This seemed obvious to everyone – except to the men who run the game.' But Booth, who also writes for Sportsmail, says Cook's eventual sacking so late made little sense . National selector James Whitaker (right) had called Cook 'our exceptional leader' Pietersen appeared on the Graham Norton Show - the presenter suggested 'team sport's not for you' England also come under attack for the way they handled the sacking of Pietersen, a situation where they had right on their side - plus the support of the bulk of those who follow the team around professionally - but somehow allowed the maverick to claim the morale high ground. A situation that, incredibly, is still going on, after Wisden went to press on this year's edition. 'The ECB's comments on the fall-out with Pietersen should have been clear and concise,' writes Booth. ______ Worse, in the eyes of those agitating for an explanation, they looked indifferent. 'It was typical of a story beyond ECB's control that their best moment was not of their own making. Having searched in vain for the words that justified his sacking, they were gifted a 324-page solution, an autobiography so full of rancour that BBC chat-show host Graham Norton suggested to Pietersen: ""Maybe, just maybe, team sport's not for you."" This year's Wisden also includes both a withering review of Pietersen's nasty book by the Mail on Sunday's Patrick Collins, who retired this year after a distinguished career, and an excellent piece of the aspect of his career totally overlooked by Pietersen in his book – batting that touched genius. Simon Hughes admirably fills the void that Pietersen left himself. Gary Ballance has been named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year in the new edition . Ballance's Yorkshire team-mate Adam Lyth, called up by England, is also in the top five . Jeetan Patel (left) and Angelo Mathews make up the remainder of Booth's top five cricketers . Sri Lanka's brilliant Kumar Sangakkara clinched the title of leading cricketer in the world . Australia's Meg Lanning (batting against England) is honoured with the inaugural women's award . The thousands of disciples of Wisden always look immediately at who the editor has chosen as his five cricketers of the year, one of the oldest and most highly regarded prizes in sport. Booth has chosen well and predictably in the cases of Moeen Ali, who has the honour of being pictured on the front cover, Gary Ballance, Adam Lyth and Angelo Mathews and enterprisingly in Jeetan Patel, who is rewarded for his prolific season for Warwickshire. To me, the award suffers in that players are only allowed to be picked once. For instance, how good would it be if, on his retirement, a player would be described as a five-time Wisden cricketer of the year? Booth is a progressive, brilliant, imaginative editor but perhaps such a move would be just a little too controversial for such a traditional vehicle as Wisden. The brilliant Kumar Sangakkara, who will be delighting championship audiences with Surrey this summer, is the leading cricketer in the world while, for the first time, there is an international woman cricketer of the year. Australia's Meg Lanning is honoured with the inaugural women's award. As ever, Wisden is a must for any cricket fan and even at a time of continuing turmoil for the England team and genuine concerns about cricket's future world-wise, it is a reassuring presence however critical the editor is of it. Moeen Ali (England and Worcestershire) England’s search for a spin bowler to replace Graeme Swann was thought to be doomed – until Moeen Ali lit up the summer with 12 wickets in the Southampton and Manchester Tests against India. He finished the series with 19 at 23 apiece. Earlier in the season he had almost saved the Headingley Test against Sri Lanka, batting for all bar one ball of the final day. And, when he was promoted to open for the one-day side, he scored the third-fastest hundred by an England batsman, from 72 balls against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Moeen Ali celebrates taking the wicket of India's Cheteshwar Pujara at Old Trafford last summer . Gary Ballance (England and Yorkshire) Gary Ballance began the summer with a century in his first home Test, against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, and followed up with two more against India – at Lord’s and Southampton. By the end of the season he boasted a Test average of over 60. Gary Ballance celebrates reaching his century during the third test with India in Southampton last year . Adam Lyth (England and Yorkshire) Yorkshire opening batsman Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the County Championship, with 1,489 runs at an average of 67 and six hundreds, and was one of the pillars of his team’s triumph. He was rewarded with a place on England’s tour of the Caribbean in April 2015. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the 2014 County Championship season . Angelo Mathews (Sri Lanka) Angelo Mathews was the inspiration behind Sri Lanka’s first Test series victory in England. After helping to save the First Test at Lord’s with a century, he made 160 – and took four wickets – as Sri Lanka came from behind to win in Leeds. Mathews also led his team to wins in the one-day series and the one-off Twenty20 international. Angelo Mathews after making 160 for Sri Lanka in the second Test with England at Headingley . Jeetan Patel (New Zealand and Warwickshire) New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel was central to Warwickshire’s success across all three formats. He claimed 107 victims in total, more than anyone in the country, and his 25 wickets in the NatWest T20 Blast – the most in the competition – helped his side lift the trophy on home turf at Edgbaston. Jeetan Patel takes the final wicket as Warwickshire beat Middlesex in last year's County Championship .","'If you're widely regarded as a pain it helps if you're scoring lots more runs than anyone else.

The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners.

Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch.

Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four.

Aitor Karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from Watford were it not for the probability they’d spend most of the journey travelling in circles. This was that kind of game, a top-of-the-table occasion when Middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale – they did not create, they did not contain. They might have survived with deficiencies in one department, but not both. What a cruel time to deliver one of their worst performances of a brilliant season. What a cruel time for the Championship’s best defence to explode at the seams. Odion Ighalo's shot flies into the top corner of Dimi Konstantopoulos' net on 65 minutes . Watford (3-5-2): Gomes; Cathcart (Connolly 60), Angella, Hoban; Paredes, Guedioura (Layun 90), Watson, Tozser, Anya; Deeney, Ighalo (Vydra 69). Subs not used: Bond, Pudil, Munari, Abdi. ______ Booked: Reach. Referee: Mike Jones (Cheshire) Attendance: 19,656. They gifted Troy Deeney his 20th goal of the season and they contributed significantly to Odion Ighalo scoring his 19th in the second half. With that, Watford rose and Middlesbrough fell. That has been the way of this remarkable season in this peculiar division, for which everyone and no-one has staked a claim. The Championship lead which Boro held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times, with Watford back in prominence and Karanka sounding like a man searching for a positive note. Karanka said: ‘The players are completely destroyed but I am very proud of them. We have players who have come from League One and other teams in the Championship, a lot of young players, and we are fighting with the best teams in the Championship. No one could have expected this position. ‘The people who know me and this team know we will fight to the last second. I don’t want to forget our position is amazing.’ True enough, but the reality is Boro have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot. They were woeful in falling at Bournemouth last month and have now lost four of their past five away games. Jonathan Woodgate slides in vain to try and block Troy Deeney's opening goal . The Watford captain managed to slide the ball under Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos . Deeney celebrates with his team-mates after giving Watford a first-half lead . But their misery has been Watford’s gain. What a luxury to have two strikers as effective as Deeney and Ighalo. They were, as Karanka said, ‘the difference’. And in the context of the season, their combined 39 goals are pulling the sleigh. Here, they had help. In the first instance, for Deeney’s 37th-minute opener, Jonathan Woodgate and Dwight Tiendalli made a hash of the basics. Adlene Guedioura was given too much time to cross from the right and Woodgate misread the flight, allowing the ball to fall in the space behind him. Tiendalli could have covered but was out of position. At this level, in that situation, there can be fewer worse sights for a pair of defenders than Deeney. His touch was perfect and so was the finish - ruthless brilliance from a striker who has now scored 20 goals in each of his past three campaigns. He is the only Watford player in history to do that; he more than most deserves a chance to see what he can do at the higher level. ‘He’s a Premier League player,’ said Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic. ‘It’s just a question of whether we are all together as a Premier League team.’ Watford made it 2-0 with 25 minutes to go. Again, the ease with which Ighalo turned Woodgate will have bothered Karanka, as will Grant Leadbitter’s sloppy concession of the ball in the build-up. But, really, it was all about the finish, the striker’s shot hitting the top corner from the edge of the area. Ighalo said he only joined Watford for the prospect of Premier League football. He might just get it. Jokanovic said: ‘I expect this victory can help us to win points a little bit more easily in the future. But in front of us is a very serious job.’ Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes gets a boot to the face from Middlesbrough forward Patrick bamford .

Yarde excelled in Saturday's roller-coaster Aviva Premiership victory over Gloucester, scoring the crucial try in the 70th minute at The Stoop. The 22-year-old wing won the last of his seven caps as a replacement last autumn, but was overlooked by England throughout the RBS 6 Nations. Harlequins winger Charlie Walker crosses for his side's first try at the Stoop . ‘We’ve had a difficult year, but anyone who has watched him will know he’s been absolutely outstanding. When we get back to winning he will get recognition again,’ O'Shea said. Quins spent most of an uninspiring mid-table clash feeding off scraps due to the overwhelming superiority of the visiting scrum, only to produce the key drive in the 70th minute that was finished by Marland Yarde. ______ Yarde seized the initiative for the London club and full-back Ollie Lindsay-Hague appeared to have sealed the victory, only for Dan Robson's try with a minute left to give Gloucester a faint glimmer of hope until they aimlessly kicked the ball away in the last act of the game. The opening 10 minutes were dominated by Gloucester's scrum, yet it was Quins who opened the scoring when outside centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma jinked into space before sending Charlie Walker over. Walker's try was the result of a clinical counter attack, but the 2012 Premiership champions were immediately back under pressure once play resumed with their set-piece targeted once more, conceding a penalty that Greig Laidlaw sent between the uprights. Gloucester No 8 Gareth Evans is hit hard by Quins flanker Jack Clifford . Laidlaw and Evans exchanged penalties and just as Quins began to attack with greater frequency, yet another retreating scrum gave Gloucester the platform to race into a 31st minute lead. Hook broke the gainline with a large dummy - his second of the afternoon - and found Bill Meakes in support, with the outside centre showing strength to force his way over from 10 yards out. Gloucester's set-piece dominance was rewarded when Pearce sent Marler to the sin bin, but they were unable to turn a push late in the first half into points. A big step and outside-break from full-back Lindsay-Hague created a half-chance for Yarde moments after the interval, but the England wing was well tackled. Harry Sloan tries to evade the clutches of Cherry and Whites flanker Sione Kalamafoni . It was then Gloucester's turn to find space through Jonny May down the right wing only for Sharples to drop what should have been a try scoring pass. Two attacking scrums later, however, and Sharples dived over after Meakes had spotted the overlap caused by Quins being sucked into the one-sided forward exchanges. Evans' boot whittled down the deficit to one point but as the match entered the final quarter number eight Jack Clifford was shown a yellow card for a shoulder challenge on Sharples and Laidlaw rifled over the ensuing penalty. Gloucester scrum half Dan Robson crosses the Quins whitewash for a late score . Despite being a man down, Quins almost scored with two successive rolling mauls and on both occasions Gloucester saw a player sin-binned - replacement lock Ross Moriarty for bringing down the first drive and Sharples for a deliberate knock on. On the third line-out catch and drive they succeeded, with Yarde touching down as the game entered the final 10 minutes. Lindsay-Hague and replacement scrum-half Robson then swapped late tries to bring the game to a dramatic if scrappy conclusion.","As half time drew close, referee Luke Pearce had finally lost patience with Harlequins set-piece frailty and pointed the finger at Joe Marler by sending the club captain to the sin-bin. Gloucester only entered the interval 13-11 ahead - a poor return given their ascendency - and then moved 18-11 clear through a Charlie Sharples try with half an hour remaining to suggest their eighth win of the season was imminent. Quins centre Aseli Tikoirotuma puts in a strong fend on Gloucester lock James Hudson . The kicking of Nick Evans kept Quins in touch - the Kiwi fly-half finished with 14 points - before an eventful final quarter produced a flurry of yellow cards and three tries.","The word to fill in is:

The Foxes go to West Brom on Saturday bottom of the Barclays Premier League and six points adrift from the survival line. A 2-1 win over West Ham last weekend gave them a first victory in nine league games and ended a run of just two points from a possible 24. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson (fourth right) talks to his squad during a training session . Pearson watches on at the Foxes training ground as he plans their route to Premier League survival . But with eight games left Pearson knows that they cannot afford any further slip ups. 'Our form has to take that upward trend in terms of results. We don't really have a buffer to fall back on, we have to perform here on in,' he said at his pre-match press conference. 'The players have dealt with an awful lot of disappointment but strived to get the performances. That has been the case for the majority of the season. What we have to do now is change those performances into wins. 'People tell me about other people's run-ins but you will survive or not due to your own results. 'We have to keep it in our hands for as long as possible and we need to win more games. That's the reality of the situation but we're capable of it.' Leicester still have to play relegation rivals Burnley and Sunderland and host QPR on the final day, giving Pearson hope. He said: 'We have to play a lot of sides around us. ______ 'You win a game or lose a game and there's a shift in terms of how people perceive it.' Matthew Upson (centre) is back in contention for the game with West Brom after returning from injury . Dean Hammond (centre) is also back in training with Leicester following a calf problem . Matt Upson (Achilles) and Dean Hammond (calf) are back in training and are available for the trip to The Hawthorns, where Pearson spent time as coach between 2004 and 2006. The Baggies are holding Jeff Astle Day to honour their former striker and raise awareness for the Jeff Astle Foundation. Former Albion striker Astle died in 2002 aged 59 from a brain condition normally linked to boxing after heading heavy leather footballs during his career. And while Pearson believes it is a fine cause he insisted the Foxes cannot get caught up in the day. He said: 'In many ways it's for recognition for an outstanding player and person who has achieved an awful lot for the football club. 'It's great West Brom have decided to make an occasion to celebrate Jeff Astle's contribution and raise awareness of these types of head injury issues. 'But for us, unfortunately, we have to recognise we are part of the day but our own plight is the most important thing. 'What we can't do is get carried away in the occasion.'","It's nice to have games where we can directly affect their end to the season but the flip side is they will see it the same way.

43987,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,917,1,2,"Even by his stratospheric standards, this was something very special. Cristiano Ronaldo was back to his brilliant, unplayable best as he scored five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 rout of Granada on Sunday, among them an eight-minute hat-trick. That treble was Ronaldo's 31st career hat-trick and his 24th in La Liga, equalling Lionel Messi's record in the competition. It also took his formidable goal tally for the Bernabeu club to 299 in 287 matches. Against Granada, Ronaldo has now scored 11 times in just eight matches. But, compared with some, they have got off quite lightly. We take a look at the clubs who have suffered the most at the hands of the Portuguese wonder. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals as Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 on Sunday afternoon . The Portuguese superstar was simply irresistible as Real ran riot at the Bernabeu . SEVILLA - 18 Goals in 12 matches . There's no denying it - Ronaldo just loves playing against Sevilla, whose defence must be terrified every time they see him. Three of those La Liga hat-tricks have come against the team from Andalusia - he scored triples in a 6-2 win at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in May 2011, a 4-1 success at the Bernabeu in February 2013 and a 7-3 thrashing in October of the same year. But they aren't even Ronaldo's best return. He scored four goals, including a 12-minute hat-trick, in another 6-2 win in Seville back in May 2011. Most recently, Ronaldo scored twice in Real's 2-0 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla in August. Ronaldo celebrates with James Rodriguez after scoring in Real's 2014 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla . ATLETICO MADRID - 15 Goals in 20 matches . Madrid derbies have been pretty common in recent years - not only in La Liga but also in the Copa del Rey (they're met in four of the last five seasons) and, of course, last season's Champions League final. In the 2011-12 league fixtures, Ronaldo scored twice against Atleti at the Bernabeu and three times against them at Vicente Calderon. Both matches ended in 4-1 wins for Real. But the most famous was in Lisbon last May, when Ronaldo scored Real's fourth in the Champions League final and ran off for that shirtless celebration. Ronaldo whips off his shirt to celebrate scoring the fourth goal in Real's 2014 Champions League final win . BARCELONA - 15 Goals in 26 matches . As a Manchester United player, Ronaldo failed to score in five meetings with Barcelona but that soon changed when he switched to Real Madrid in 2009. Scored: 417 goals . Against: 82 clubs . He scored an extra-time header to win the Copa del Rey final of 2011 and claim his first piece of silverware at the Bernabeu. And the Clasico goals have flowed regularly since - Ronaldo has scored seven against Barca in the league, five in the Copa del Rey and three in the Supercopa. With Ronaldo and Messi in a never-ending 'anything you can do' contest, there should be many more to come. Lionel Messi was left scratching his head after Ronaldo scored in the Clasico last October . GETAFE - 15 Goals in nine matches . Ronaldo really has it in for Getafe with an excellent scoring ratio against Madrid's city rivals. He notched hat-tricks against them in both the 2010-11 season and the 2012-13 campaign and added two more in a 3-0 Real win when the sides met at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez back in January. I doubt Getafe are looking forward to their last-day visit to the Bernabeu very much... Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Getafe at the Bernabeu in May 2011 . ATHLETIC BILBAO - 14 Goals in 12 matches . Another team Ronaldo averages better than a goal a game against is Bilbao. He topped up his impressive record against the Basques with a hat-trick in a 5-0 home win earlier this season. That was the second time he has scored three against them - the other came in a 5-1 Bernabeu victory in November 2010. Ronaldo also registered doubles in a 4-1 win in January 2012 and a 3-0 win at San Mames in April 2013. Ronaldo heads home Real's second goal against Athletic Bilbao in a La Liga meeting in September 2013 . MALAGA - 13 Goals in 13 matches . Ronaldo has Malaga in the crosshairs too, averaging a goal a game in his 13 encounters with them. He has scored two hat-tricks against them, in a 7-0 demolition at the Bernabeu in March 2011 and a 4-0 success at La Rosaleda in October the same year. It almost came as a surprise when Ronaldo failed to find the net against them back in November - but he did contribute two assists instead. Ronaldo wheels away in celebration after scoring against Malaga back in January 2010 . CELTA VIGO - 12 goals in six matches . Ronaldo's best scoring ratio is against Celta Vigo where he has an incredible average of two goals a game. Admittedly, there have only been six games since Celta returned to the top flight but nearly all of them have been messy. Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 home win earlier this season and he also scored three in a Copa del Rey tie in January 2013. Indeed, Ronaldo has scored every time he's faced them. Ronaldo averages two goals a game against Celta Vigo - including this one in December 2014 . LEVANTE - 12 Goals in 11 matches . Levante have also served as target practice for Ronaldo too over the years, with the goals coming at regular intervals. Earlier this season, Ronaldo helped himself to two as Real routed them 5-0 at the Ciutat de Valencia. A Copa del Rey tie in December 2010 saw Ronaldo score three of Real's eight strikes. On target for Real in an away La Liga match with Levante back in November 2012 . VILLARREAL - 11 Goals in 13 matches . After drawing a blank four times against Villarreal with Manchester United, Ronaldo has well and truly made up for lost time. He has scored 11 times in nine La Liga encounters, including a hat-trick in a 4-2 home win in January 2011 (plus an assist for good measure). Ronaldo extended his scoring streak against the Yellow Submarine this season, netting both home and away. A high-five for Gareth Bale after scoring against Villarreal earlier this season. The game ended 2-2 . GRANADA - 11 Goals in eight matches . Ronaldo sliced through the Granada defence on Sunday like a knife through butter, registering the first five-goal haul of his career. He also took his impressive tally against this particular opponent to 11 goals in eight outings. Ronaldo points to the heavens after scoring for Real Madrid against Granada last season . RONALDO AGAINST THE ENGLISH TEAMS . Ronaldo's prolific scoring record against the Spanish clubs means you have to go down to No 16 on the overall list to find the Premier League opponent he has scored most against. It's Aston Villa - Ronaldo scored nine times in 14 matches against them during his time with Manchester United. He also has eight in 16 meetings with Tottenham Hotspur. But how about the leading teams in England? ARSENAL - Six goals in 15 matches . Ronaldo mustered half a dozen goals for Manchester United against the Gunners during his six seasons at Old Trafford. The most significant were the two at the Emirates to deliver United into the 2009 Champions League final, while he also scored twice in a 4-2 success at Highbury in February 2005. Ronaldo celebrates his stunning free-kick for Manchester United in the Champions League semi with Arsenal . MANCHESTER CITY - Five goals in 13 matches . Ronaldo scored four times in Manchester derbies during his time at Old Trafford - and also found the target against City for Real Madrid in a 2012 Champions League tie. His most telling contribution was a penalty at the Etihad in May 2007 as United beat their rivals 1-0 en route to the Premier League title. A youthful Ronaldo scored twice as United beat City 4-2 in an FA Cup tie in February 2004 . LIVERPOOL - Three goals in 11 matches . Ronaldo has struggled for goals against Liverpool - scoring twice against them for United and then adding another in Real's 3-0 win at Anfield earlier this season. That was his first time scoring at Anfield as the other two came at Old Trafford in contrasting circumstances - a 3-0 win in March 2008 and a 4-1 loss in March 2009. Ronaldo draws the ire of the Anfield crowd after scoring there for Real Madrid earlier this season . MANCHESTER UNITED - Two goals in two matches . Ronaldo came back to haunt Sir Alex Ferguson and United by scoring in both legs of their 2013 Champions League last-16 tie. His header cancelled out Danny Welbeck's opener in the Bernabeu and he then scored the decisive goal at Old Trafford - refusing to celebrate - after Nani had been sent off for United. Ronaldo refused to celebrate after scoring the goal that knocked Man United out of Europe in 2013 . CHELSEA - One goal in 15 matches . Ronaldo's record against Chelsea is poor - having found the net just once against the London side in 15 appearances. Mind you, it was an incredibly important one, a header in the 2008 Champions League final as United claimed their third European Cup triumph. Ronaldo towers above the Chelsea defence to head home during the 2008 Champions League final . 18 - Sevilla . ______ 11 - Villarreal, Granada . 10 - Osasuna . 9 - Aston Villa, Valencia, Rayo Vallecano, Real Sociedad, Deportivo . 8 - Tottenham . 7 - Schalke, Ajax, Zaragoza, Mallorca, Elche, Almeria, Fulham, Wigan . 6 - Racing Santander, Galatasaray, Arsenal, Bolton, Newcastle, Portsmouth . 5 - Everton, Manchester City, West Ham, Middlesbrough . 4 - Bayern Munich, Marseille, Lyon, Xerez, Espanyol, Derby, West Brom, Reading . 3 - FC Copenhagen, Borussia Dortmund, Roma, Juventus, CSKA Moscow, Real Betis, Valldolid, Dinamo Moscow, Liverpool, Blackburn . 2 - Ludogorets, AC Milan, Sporting Lisbon, Basle, Zurich, Eibar, Gijon, Hercules, APOEL, Southampton, Birmingham, Stoke, Hull, Manchester United, Watford . 1 - Auxerre, Inter, Gamba Osaka, Porto, Murcia, Tenerife, Cordoba, Ponferradina, Debreceni, Sunderland, Charlton, Chelsea, Millwall, Exeter .","15 - Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Getafe . 14 - Atletico Bilbao . 13 - Malaga . 12 - Celta Vigo, Levante .","The blank denoted by "" Laliga"" represents the league the Madrileones are playing in.

Many users have deemed the tribute 'touching' and 'beautiful'. One told James - who competed against the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night - that it 'was so sweet it brought me to tears'. Lauren, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had repeatedly defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December.

The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times . Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left. Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013, and right, in December 2014, after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare childhood brain cancer which changed her appearance . Brave: Lauren, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December - months before she passed away . In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter (left) and St Patrick's Day (right) from hospital in Cincinnati . Fighter: The NCAA moved Mount St. Joseph's first basketball game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets . The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' ______ Dear Lauren Hill, .

The restaurant's owner – Mr Wing himself – is never afraid to push for as much publicity as possible, and is often snapped in the photographs with the city's celebrities at his five-star venue. Wing's has been 'recommended in the Mitchelin Guide for the past eight years', according to their website, but how else does it lure Manchester's footballers and stars back time and time again like moths to a flame? Here's all you need to know about Wing's restaurant. So, who goes there? Wing's is rarely short of a Manchester United star or two. The Class of '92 – Gary and Phil Neville, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, minus David Beckham – previously dined there. Yet more regular visitors include current first-team players and their manager. Wayne Rooney, in particular, visits the restaurant with his wife, Coleen, and has even helped them with publicity work. The United and England captain celebrated his last two birthdays at Wing's, and held a Q&A session at the restaurant after starring in a video ahead of the Chinese New Year on February 19.

The reputation must spread around the changing room quick, because Radamel Falcao dined at Wing's on the same day he signed for Manchester United in a £6million loan deal from Monaco. Falcao tweeted a photograph with agent Jorge Mendes and his lawyers, Paulo Rendeiro and Carlos Osorio, while enjoying a glass of wine, some prawn crackers and a Chinese meal. There has also been Nani, Sir Alex Ferguson, and plenty others. Radamel Falcao went to Wing's Chinese restaurant on the day he signed for United on loan from Monaco .

There was former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole with Cheryl from their time together, and former Old Trafford youngster Danny Simpson with ex-partner Tulisa Contostavlos, too.

The England striker later deleted the post. Some feel it overstepped boundaries, given the rivalry between the red and blue halves of Manchester, and Van Gaal admits he would avoid Wing's following a defeat.

The Elite Round Group 4 qualifier will be restarted at 9:45pm at Seaview stadium in Belfast on Thursday with the match resuming with England retaking a penalty in the 96th minute at 2-1 down. England's 3-1 Group 4 victory against Switzerland on Thursday afternoon means the Young Lionesses will qualify for the European Championships if the penalty is scored and the match is drawn 2-2.

Leah Williamson steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against Norway . Williamson runs forward to strike the ball but team-mate Rosella Ayane (circled) has entered the box . Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month . Jenna Dear scored twice at the Seaview Stadium while Leah Williamson, who is set to take the last minute spot-kick against Norway, earned some practice as she scored past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot from 12-yards. Norway are second in the group following an impressive 8-1 win against Northern Ireland, but crucially have a slightly inferior goal difference meaning the spot-kick will give England a place in the European Championship finals in Israel. The astonishing decision has been taken for the first time in a UEFA competition following an FA appeal after the referee had wrongly denied England the opportunity to retake the penalty during Saturday's match following encroachment. England midfielder Williamson thought she had equalised after slotting the ball into the bottom-right corner but team-mate Rosella Ayane had entered the box too early and German referee Marija Kurtes disallowed the goal. However, instead of ordering it to be retaken, 28-year-old Kurtes - who was named Referee of the Year by the German Football Association (DFB) in 2014 - wrongly awarded an indirect free-kick to Norway. According to the laws of the game, a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team-mates of the player taking the kick. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday .

April 6 - England 9-1 Northern Ireland . April 9 - Switzerland 1-3 England . April 9 - Northern Ireland 1-8 Norway . A scene of apparent confusion followed England's wild celebrations as Kurtes explained her decision. Williamson had grabbed back the ball to retake the penalty and placed it on the penalty spot before realising an indirect free-kick had been awarded. Two Norwegian players then embraced as they celebrated the decision. A UEFA statement read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has ordered the match to be replayed. 'The replay of the match should be carried out as follows: . 'The match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the Football Association at the European Women's Under-19 Championship 2015 match between England vs Norway played on April 4, 2015, and extended according to the discretion of the referee. 'The penalty kick shall be retaken by the Football Association. 'According to the Laws of the Game (Law 14), a team-mate of the player taking the kick infringes the Laws of the Game: . - the referee allows the kick to be taken . - if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken . - if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred . 'As the ball entered the goal, the kick should have been re-taken. Thus the CDEB ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 (e) and 7 (2) of the disciplinary regulations. Williamson scored from the penalty spot during England's 3-1 victory against Switzerland on Thursday . Jenna Dear (right) scores with a header as England inched closer to European Championship qualification . 'The match is scheduled to take place at the Seaview Stadium in Belfast on Thursday at 9:45pm local time with another referee. 'Teams must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment. Any of these players can take the penalty kick.' An FA spokesperson said: 'After England Women U19s' match against Norway on Saturday, April 4, the FA lodged an appeal to UEFA following a disallowed penalty. 'Due to an incorrect application of the game's laws by the match referee, UEFA have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty. 'The remainder of the match will be played on Thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium – Seaview, Belfast.' Williamson is congratulated by her England team-mates after scoring past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot . Former Everton and England captain Mo Marley is head coach of the national women's U19 team . Although it will only last 18 seconds, officials, stewards and paramedics will all be required to attend. Admission is free. England, coached by former national captain Mo Marley, were 2-0 down to Norway on Saturday before substitute Ayane pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point. However, Wiliiamson's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat. ______ However, a different player can take the penalty. The decision further complicates the already complex qualification process for July's finals after UEFA had announced that Norway had sealed their place. After an initial qualifying round last year, the Elite Round is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across Europe. The six group winners and best-placed runner-up - decided by the best record against the first and third-placed teams in the groups - go through to join hosts Israel at the showpiece event in July.

The Elite Round Group 4 qualifier will be restarted at 9:45pm at Seaview stadium in Belfast on Thursday with the match resuming with England retaking a penalty in the 96th minute at 2-1 down. England's 3-1 Group 4 victory against Switzerland on Thursday afternoon means the Young Lionesses will qualify for the European Championships if the penalty is scored and the match is drawn 2-2.

Williamson turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper's bottom-right corner . German referee Marija Kurtes officiating a women's Bundesliga match in Munich last month . Jenna Dear scored twice at the Seaview Stadium while Leah Williamson, who is set to take the last minute spot-kick against Norway, earned some practice as she scored past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot from 12-yards. Norway are second in the group following an impressive 8-1 win against Northern Ireland, but crucially have a slightly inferior goal difference meaning the spot-kick will give England a place in the European Championship finals in Israel. The astonishing decision has been taken for the first time in a UEFA competition following an FA appeal after the referee had wrongly denied England the opportunity to retake the penalty during Saturday's match following encroachment. England midfielder Williamson thought she had equalised after slotting the ball into the bottom-right corner but team-mate Rosella Ayane had entered the box too early and German referee Marija Kurtes disallowed the goal. However, instead of ordering it to be retaken, 28-year-old Kurtes - who was named Referee of the Year by the German Football Association (DFB) in 2014 - wrongly awarded an indirect free-kick to Norway. According to the laws of the game, a penalty should be retaken if it entered the goal after encroachment by team-mates of the player taking the kick. England players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against Norway . But referee Kurtes awards an indirect free-kick and the celebrations are cut short . Williamson has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake . But Williamson then realises the referee's decision and two Norwegian players are seen celebrating . German referee Kurtes is understood to have been sent home following her error on Saturday . April 4 - England 1-2 Norway (Match to be replayed from 96th min on April 9 at 9:45pm) April 4 - Switzerland 1-0 Northern Ireland . April 6 - Norway 2-0 Switzerland . April 6 - England 9-1 Northern Ireland . April 9 - Switzerland 1-3 England . April 9 - Northern Ireland 1-8 Norway . A scene of apparent confusion followed England's wild celebrations as Kurtes explained her decision. Williamson had grabbed back the ball to retake the penalty and placed it on the penalty spot before realising an indirect free-kick had been awarded. Two Norwegian players then embraced as they celebrated the decision. A UEFA statement read: 'The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has ordered the match to be replayed. 'The replay of the match should be carried out as follows: . 'The match will be replayed from the minute the penalty kick was awarded to the Football Association at the European Women's Under-19 Championship 2015 match between England vs Norway played on April 4, 2015, and extended according to the discretion of the referee. 'The penalty kick shall be retaken by the Football Association. 'According to the Laws of the Game (Law 14), a team-mate of the player taking the kick infringes the Laws of the Game: . - the referee allows the kick to be taken . - if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken . - if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the infringement occurred . 'As the ball entered the goal, the kick should have been re-taken. Thus the CDEB ordered that the remaining time of the match should be replayed in accordance with article 6 (e) and 7 (2) of the disciplinary regulations. Williamson scored from the penalty spot during England's 3-1 victory against Switzerland on Thursday . Jenna Dear (right) scores with a header as England inched closer to European Championship qualification . 'The match is scheduled to take place at the Seaview Stadium in Belfast on Thursday at 9:45pm local time with another referee. 'Teams must field the same players which were on the pitch at that moment. Any of these players can take the penalty kick.' An FA spokesperson said: 'After England Women U19s' match against Norway on Saturday, April 4, the FA lodged an appeal to UEFA following a disallowed penalty. 'Due to an incorrect application of the game's laws by the match referee, UEFA have ordered the match to be replayed from the point of the penalty. 'The remainder of the match will be played on Thursday at 9.45pm at the same stadium – Seaview, Belfast.' Williamson is congratulated by her England team-mates after scoring past Swiss goalkeeper Tania Chassot . Former Everton and England captain Mo Marley is head coach of the national women's U19 team . Although it will only last 18 seconds, officials, stewards and paramedics will all be required to attend. Admission is free. England, coached by former national captain Mo Marley, were 2-0 down to Norway on Saturday before substitute Ayane pulled one back in the 87th minute to give her side hope of claiming a point. However, Wiliiamson's penalty was disallowed and the match ended in defeat. ______ However, a different player can take the penalty. The decision further complicates the already complex qualification process for July's finals after UEFA had announced that Norway had sealed their place. After an initial qualifying round last year, the Elite Round is comprised of six groups of four teams playing at locations across Europe. The six group winners and best-placed runner-up - decided by the best record against the first and third-placed teams in the groups - go through to join hosts Israel at the showpiece event in July. England women's senior head coach Mark Sampson tweeted: 'Difficult circumstances for our @england U19.

Yarde excelled in Saturday's roller-coaster Aviva Premiership victory over Gloucester, scoring the crucial try in the 70th minute at The Stoop. The 22-year-old wing won the last of his seven caps as a replacement last autumn, but was overlooked by England throughout the RBS 6 Nations. Harlequins winger Charlie Walker crosses for his side's first try at the Stoop . ‘We’ve had a difficult year, but anyone who has watched him will know he’s been absolutely outstanding. When we get back to winning he will get recognition again,’ O'Shea said. Quins spent most of an uninspiring mid-table clash feeding off scraps due to the overwhelming superiority of the visiting scrum, only to produce the key drive in the 70th minute that was finished by Marland Yarde. ______ Yarde seized the initiative for the London club and full-back Ollie Lindsay-Hague appeared to have sealed the victory, only for Dan Robson's try with a minute left to give Gloucester a faint glimmer of hope until they aimlessly kicked the ball away in the last act of the game. The opening 10 minutes were dominated by Gloucester's scrum, yet it was Quins who opened the scoring when outside centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma jinked into space before sending Charlie Walker over. Walker's try was the result of a clinical counter attack, but the 2012 Premiership champions were immediately back under pressure once play resumed with their set-piece targeted once more, conceding a penalty that Greig Laidlaw sent between the uprights. Gloucester No 8 Gareth Evans is hit hard by Quins flanker Jack Clifford . Laidlaw and Evans exchanged penalties and just as Quins began to attack with greater frequency, yet another retreating scrum gave Gloucester the platform to race into a 31st minute lead. Hook broke the gainline with a large dummy - his second of the afternoon - and found Bill Meakes in support, with the outside centre showing strength to force his way over from 10 yards out. Gloucester's set-piece dominance was rewarded when Pearce sent Marler to the sin bin, but they were unable to turn a push late in the first half into points. A big step and outside-break from full-back Lindsay-Hague created a half-chance for Yarde moments after the interval, but the England wing was well tackled. Harry Sloan tries to evade the clutches of Cherry and Whites flanker Sione Kalamafoni . It was then Gloucester's turn to find space through Jonny May down the right wing only for Sharples to drop what should have been a try scoring pass. Two attacking scrums later, however, and Sharples dived over after Meakes had spotted the overlap caused by Quins being sucked into the one-sided forward exchanges. Evans' boot whittled down the deficit to one point but as the match entered the final quarter number eight Jack Clifford was shown a yellow card for a shoulder challenge on Sharples and Laidlaw rifled over the ensuing penalty. Gloucester scrum half Dan Robson crosses the Quins whitewash for a late score . Despite being a man down, Quins almost scored with two successive rolling mauls and on both occasions Gloucester saw a player sin-binned - replacement lock Ross Moriarty for bringing down the first drive and Sharples for a deliberate knock on. On the third line-out catch and drive they succeeded, with Yarde touching down as the game entered the final 10 minutes. Lindsay-Hague and replacement scrum-half Robson then swapped late tries to bring the game to a dramatic if scrappy conclusion.","As half time drew close, referee Luke Pearce had finally lost patience with Harlequins set-piece frailty and pointed the finger at Joe Marler by sending the club captain to the sin-bin. Gloucester only entered the interval 13-11 ahead - a poor return given their ascendency - and then moved 18-11 clear through a Charlie Sharples try with half an hour remaining to suggest their eighth win of the season was imminent. Quins centre Aseli Tikoirotuma puts in a strong fend on Gloucester lock James Hudson . The kicking of Nick Evans kept Quins in touch - the Kiwi fly-half finished with 14 points - before an eventful final quarter produced a flurry of yellow cards and three tries.","The missing 4 sentences are:

You watch his right foot, he goes back with his left foot now...' But before Vaughan could finish his sentence Cook was tempted to follow a Jerome Taylor delivery outside off stump and squirted a waist-high catch to gully for 13. Despite being the favourite for the director of cricket job, Vaughan is seeking more clarity over the role. Speaking earlier this week, he said: 'I think the role needs to be defined, what exactly it is and what the team require. I don't think anyone can say whether they are interested or not until then. 'All I've said is I'd like to know what that role is, as Andrew Strauss has said, and Alec Stewart. All of us would be ¬interested if the role was right. So it's just a case of waiting to see.'

You can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world. No pressure. No big whoop. Judging by some of the stuff said and written about Woods in the build-up to his 20th Masters, it will be an achievement if he makes the cut. Very respected names have close to begged him not to compete. Woods doesn’t see it like that at all. He’s in it to win it. And it’s in those little moments that the old Tiger — some would argue the real Tiger — breaks cover again. Tiger Woods was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the Masters . The former best player in the world arrives at Augusta ranked a lowly 111th in the game . Woods name appears on the Masters' tournament winner's board four times; 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005 . It was all smiles and wise-cracks as Woods sat before the assembled press on Tuesday. Questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon. Memory lane was tripped down, the elder statesman played. He even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends. And then he was asked where a win this week, from one ranking place lower than Tomohiro Kondo of Japan, at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again, would rank in his career achievements. And up leapt old Tiger. He didn’t answer this one with a short, evocative speech or a ready quip. He shut it down, old school. One sentence, no messing, no prospect of elaboration. Woods has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it . The 39-year-old looks towards the ground after hitting a shot during practice on Monday . Woods smiles as he talks with his traditional practice partner Mark O'Meara (left) at Augusta . ‘It would be my 15th major,’ said Woods. The temperature in the room dropped by several degrees. Brevity replaced levity. The questioner, gamely, tried again with a slight rephrase. ‘Long way to go before that,’ Woods replied. ‘Lot of work to do.’ He smiled. The chill passed. And, of course, that is exactly what it would be. Just his 15th major, if it signalled a true return to form. And on to the next one. World No 4 Jordan Spieth was in ninth grade — 14 years old — when Woods won his last major in 2008. But if he could win a fifth Masters he would be back in the game. And no more Mr Nice Guy, one feels. From 111th in the world, Woods has time to take the scenic route in conversation. Back to where he was, back to contending, he would be all business again. Not entirely like before, of course, because he could never go back to before — but not many of the guys who are genuinely fancied to be wearing the green jacket on Sunday night practised as Woods did, with partner and kids in tow. Woods gets a hug from his children,  Charlie and Sam, who will carry his bag for the par three tournament . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn leads the pair around the course to watch their father practice . Ski champion Vonn has a chat with tournament favourite Rory McIlroy during practice . As Woods putted, Lindsey Vonn, a world champion skier, clutched Charlie and Sam and chatted to a passing Rory McIlroy. The contrast was clear. McIlroy, whose easy manner and charisma require no effort, is not here to smell the azaleas. He is the world’s best golfer, on the brink of a third consecutive major in what would be a personal Grand Slam — only the sixth in the world to do it. He has a lot at stake. Woods is on bonus time. In January, he shot an 82, 11-over-par, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, his worst round in close to 13 years. A week later, he walked off at Torrey Pines after 11 holes citing back problems. His partner that day, Chris DiMarco, thought it was more out of embarrassment. ‘He wasn’t doing anything good,’ he said. Woods then took an indefinite break from golf, with claims he had the chipping yips. On Monday he admitted being stuck between two release patterns, which amounts to the same thing. When he spoke of his journey to this point of return, it was clear he regards it as the second — maybe third, considering the events of 2009 — phase of his career.

It would come for 10 minutes and then I’d lose it for an hour. Then I’d get it back. Gradually, it flipped. I’d have it for an hour, lose it for 10 minutes. And then it was just there. There were some frustrating moments, but I had to stick with it. There were times when clubs flew, when a few suddenly slipped out of my hand — and travelled some good distances. ‘But we kept working, shot by shot, hour by hour. It was slow and steady, just taking little bits of progression. I had to hammer it out, make sure it was engrained. I just had to get through it.’ Woods smiles after winning his last major in a play-off with Rocco Mediate at the 2008 US Open . The all conquering American celebrates winning the Masters after sinking a play-off putt in 2005 . Nick Faldo slips the green jacket on Woods after he won his first major at the 1997 Masters . And now he’s through it. And America waits. For while nobody expects the player one better than Hennie Otto of South Africa to beat among the most competitive Masters fields in the modern era, that doesn’t mean there is not a desperate yearning for the impossible to happen. It doesn’t help that the man in Woods’s place is not Bubba Watson, or Rickie Fowler, or any of the other star spangled pretenders, but a 25-year-old from Belfast who plays for the wrong team when the Ryder Cup is on. America likes Rory, but it loves Tiger. His victories once caused a spike in Wall Street’s Monday morning figures, and golf’s television numbers have not recovered from his spell in recovery. So the positive lines in Woods’s Masters preparation are lapped up and thrown out as a potential feelgood hit of the summer. That’s why Woods is still, against all logic, asked about winning here. Why he plays the game, and talks about winning right back at them. ‘I prepare to win and expect to go and do that,’ he said. ‘I’ve come close in the last 10 years. Half of the tournaments since 2005 I had a chance on the back nine. I just didn’t get it done. For whatever reason, I didn’t seize the opportunity.’ The former champion has spoken of practicing his game from dawn until dusk to hone his swing .

Woods was asked what, at 39, remained his greatest motivation. ‘Winning,’ deadpanned old Tiger, suddenly solemn. And then he smiled. ‘I like it,’ he said, before disappearing through a side door.

120724,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,2516,2,0,"Terry Richardson is both one of the most famous and most controversial photographers in the fashion industry. Known as much for his racy - often pornographic - photo shoots as he is for the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him. And this week he faced accusations from the model Kate Upton that he had released footage of her dancing in a bikini without her permission. Scroll down for video . In a new interview with Vogue Kate Upton has revealed that the photographer Terry Richardson released footage of her dancing in a bikini in a video called 'Cat Daddy' without her permission . In an excerpt from an interview Kate did with Vogue in June 2014, it was claimed that Kate was not happy with Terry for releasing the 'Cat Daddy' footage which has been viewed more than 22 million times. In the one-minute-long film, which played a huge part in Kate's rise to fame, and which was uploaded to YouTube two years ago, Kate is seen dancing seductively in a tiny red string bikini - the model says the film was not meant to be for public consumption. Alexa Chung writes in Vogue: 'Terry Richardson found himself on the receiving end of her wrath in May 2012, when he uploaded his now infamous video of Upton in a teeny-weeny bikini doing the Cat Daddy, a dance craze that appears to involve a lot of grinding, ""paws"" aloft. 'The video received millions of hits on YouTube - not to mention a number of slow-motion versions for the more discerning customer - but, at the time, Upton was horrified because the behind-the-scenes video had been filmed for fun, not something she expected would make the final cut.' Terry has worked with Miley Cyrus (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) shooting them in his New York studio . Terry sat front row at the Alexander Wang fashion show in September 2013 alongside Kanye West . When asked about the situation Kate said: 'I was like, ""That was disrespectful, you could have told me!''.' But Upton also adds that there's no bad blood over the YouTube video anymore. 'Now, obviously, it's fine.' However this is not the first time that the 49-year-old photographer who has shot everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kim Kardashian in his New York studio has faced controversy. In fact, to say Richarson's reputation precedes him would be an understatement. He is the man who the Guardian once referred to as 'fashion's shameful secret'. Known to many as 'Uncle Terry,' one of his more controversial shots includes a woman giving a man - thought to be Terry - fellatio whilst he is dressed as a horse. Further sexual shots show Richardson completely nude dressed as the devil and with models who are sexually stimulating him with their hands or mouths. Terry is a regular on the red carpet at some of the biggest event sin the world, he is pictured here heading into the Vanity Fair Oscar's party . Indeed it's been more than ten years since Terry first hit the headlines for his questionable behaviour. In 2004 an intern named 'Alex' was photographed performing oral sex on the photographer while wearing a tiara labelled 'slut', something which the Terry described at the time as, 'It's Sesame Street!' Then in 2009, a model called Sena Cech claimed that Terry's assistant had asked her to give him a handjob, apparently telling her: 'Sena, can you grab his c*** and twist it real hard? He likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it.' In 2010 a model named Rie Rasmussen confronted Terry at a party in Paris after he placed pictures of her next to underage models in his book - in America, models under the age of 18 are considered underage. She said: 'He takes girls who are young, manipulates them to take their clothes off and takes pictures of them they will be ashamed of. 'They are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.' Terry poses with Pharrell Williams (left) and James Franco (right) doing his signature thumbs up pose . Terry is good friends with Lady Gaga who has previously starred in his risque shoots - the pair were spotted hanging out together in New York in 2010 . Furthermore in 2010 one of the most disturbing allegations was made against Richardson. One model named Jamie Peck revealed that when she was 19 she worked with the photographer on two separate occasions. Jamie said that the second time she had her period and Terry asked 'to take my tampon out for him to play with. ""I love tampons!"" he said, in that psychotically upbeat way that temporarily convinces so many girls that what's fun for Uncle Terry is fun for them.' She refers to the fact that Terry wanted to make 'Tampon tea,' with her used sanitary product. Jamie revealed that she also sexually stimulated the photographer with her hand and was encouraged to do so not only by Terry but by his team after he took all of his clothes off. Terry once told the Observer of his shoots: 'A lot of it starts with me saying to a girl, ""Do you want to do nudes?"" And they're like, ""I don't want to be naked"". 'So I say, ""I'll be naked and you take the pictures. You can have the camera. You can have the phallus"".' Despite the allegations which have been levied against him Terry remains popular within the fashion industry pictured here with Ralph Lauren and Emmanuelle Alt . Last year model Sara Ziff spoke to Huffington Post Live about working with Terry and said: 'You are going to a casting to possibly shoot with him for Harper's Bazaar, whose one of his clients. 'That's a legitimate job, and he will ask you to take your clothes off for the casting and in some cases give him sexual favors. 'I have spoken with other models who have been in these situations, and he makes you feel like you're being a prude or you are somehow weird if you are not willing to just go with the flow because it's all cool. It's all fine.' She also revealed that there is a, 'ring of silence,' in the fashion industry as young women feel pressured to keep quite in order to further their careers. Richardson rarely responds to the allegations levied against him, but in March 2014 - after a model posted a piece on Reddit including a string of sexual assault accusations he wrote an open letter for Page Six. Charlotte Waters claimed that during her shoot Terry became aggressive and it 'became sexual act after sexual act.' Terry poses with Hilton sisters Paris (left) and Nicky (right) at the opening of his Terrywood exhibition in 2012 . In the letter, posted by the US gossip website, Richardson said that the accusations were 'false,' 'hate filled libelous tales.' He said: 'Enabled and protected by the freewheeling and often times anonymous nature of the Internet, people have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales about my professional and personal lives. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors, because I have come to realize that absent my voice in the conversation, all that remain are the lies.' He said: 'I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do. 'I give everyone that I work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions accordingly, and as such, it has been difficult to see myself as a target of revisionist history.' The model Daisy Lowe has previously defended Terry saying: 'He just exudes this sexual energy, so he doesn't need to ask girls to take off their clothes. Honestly, they just do it.' Terry poses with troubled actress Lindsay Lohan . Terry's lost numerous over the years and there are many people in the fashion industry who no longer work with him. These include shopping giants Target and H&M and brands such as Vogue, the New York Times and Equinox. The model Coco Rocha said in 2010: 'I've shot with [Terry Richardson], but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.'

One man has been charged with his murder while Mitchell is held on suspicion of conspiracy to murder . Mr Mitchell, who founded An Noor Mosque in Acton where Mr Arwani was a preacher until 2011, was arrested on Wednesday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. On Thursday afternoon Scotland Yard revealed they had further arrested the Jamaican national on suspicion of terrorism offences. His sister is the singer Liz Mitchell who fronted the 1970s band Boney M and whose hits include Rasputin and Daddy Cool. A spokesman for the singer declined to comment today. The siblings were raised in Britain as strict Christians, having fled the Caribbean as children. Last night Mr Mitchell's home was searched at the same time as An-Noor Mosque which he founded more than 20 years ago because 'he and his Muslim friends had nowhere to go'. They are investigating the death of Mr Arwani, a 48-year-old Syrian national who was found killed in his car last week. Search: Police visited the Wembley home of Burnell Mitchell, a director of the mosque where Mr Arwani used to preach regularly . Leslie Cooper, left, has appeared in court charged with murdering iman Abdul Hadi Arwani, right. The 61-year-old is a businessman from Jamaica . Within days of Mr Arwani's body being found last week, Metropolitan Police drafted in the help of Counter Terrorism officers 'because of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. Today a spokesman confirmed searches were ongoing at the An Noor mosque. 'Officers are fully aware of the sensitivities of conducting this search at this time and would like to thank the local Muslim community for their support and patience thus far in the necessary investigations that have occurred to date,' a Scotland Yard spokesman said. 'This remains a murder investigation and a search for the truth; it is therefore vital that the investigation is thorough which includes a detailed searches of premises.' Today the Old Bailey heard how Mr Arwani  he was killed  after being lured to north London to meet a potential client for his building company. It was then the 48-year-old was murdered by 36-year-old Leslie Cooper, a prosecutor told a judge during a pre-trial hearing. The Jamaican businessman, who was arrested while his family enjoyed a barbecue, did not enter a plea, appearing via video link from prison. ‘A member of the public noticed he had collapsed at the wheel and the car was running that morning’, prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said.

Mr Arwani rearranged the viewing for April 7, said Mr Glasgow, and was last seen alive leaving his family home at 9.30am to go to meet the man called John. ‘There was no further contact with the deceased and his family’, he added. Cooper did not speak during the hearing other than to confirm his name. He has not yet entered a plea to one charge of murder. He is one of three people to have been arrested in connection with Mr Arwani’s death. Alongside Mr Mitchell is a 53-year-old woman arrested on Thursday morning on suspicion of terrorism offences. Mr Arwani was a preacher at An Noor mosque in Acton until 2011 when he left under reportedly frayed tensions. The father of six was described by relatives as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet' upon the news of his death last week. One of his sons said he 'actively' fought extremism while friends added he was a vocal critic of the President Assad's government. He is thought to have fled Syria as a teenager after being told he would face violence to photographing damage in his home city of Hama. Speaking after his father's murder, Murhaf Arwani said: 'He just loved to help people. He did not care what your background, race or status was. 'He did not care if you were rich or poor. He just wanted to help people in need. 'He spoke up and out against the crime of terror and oppression wherever he found it. He was an advocate of peace for all and he showed us this in the way he lived his life from day to day.' Last week the Caribbean preacher who replaced Mr Arwani at An Noor Mosque denied claims the 48-year-old had left under strained relationships. Hassan Anyabwile, who was involved in an attempted coup d'etat in his native Trinidad and Tobago 25 years ago with the Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeem, told MailOnline he knew nothing of a reported dispute between Mr Arwani and the mosque. Asked about the 48-year-old's death he said: 'All I can say is from Allah we come, and to Allah we return.' He was assisted into the mosque - which currently remains closed as officers search its premises - by a bodyguard after becoming partially disabled.

And since taking over at Real Sociedad Moyes has enhanced his reputation as a manager who brings, if nothing else, solidity. In his 21 La Liga games to date Sociedad have conceded just 29 times, climbing from the relegation when Moyes took over, to an extremely comfortable tenth place. Mikel Gonzalez diverts a corner past his own goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli who fails to punch it away . Atletico Madrid celebrate after going two goals ahead after just 10 minutes, killing the match as a contest . Antoine Griezmann (left) is congratulated by Fernando Torres, but didn't celebrate against his former club .

Yet, on Tuesday night, Sociedad showed none of the qualities usually associated with their manager, capitulating inside 10 minutes against the Spanish champions. By the time Antoine Griezmann struck the hosts' second goal, lifting the ball over the hapless Geronimo Rulli after the keeper had parried Koke's shot straight to the Frenchman, Atletico could have been four up, and the game was all but over. Arda Turan had already seen his volley hit the post after being left totally unmarked from a free kick, before Mikel Gonzalez diverted the resulting corner past his own keeper after little more than 90 seconds. Soon after Griezmann narrowly failed to connect with a header after yet more shocking set-piece defending, and the former Sociedad man also came close to tricking his way through the visiting defence, only to be denied by a last-ditch tackle. David Moyes looks on as his team showed uncharacteristic defensive frailties at the Vicente Calderon . Mario Suarez holds off Sociedad forward Sergio Canales as Atletico took control and never relinquished it . Atletico Madrid's Turkish star Arda Turan, who struck the post early on, takes of Gorka Elustondo . Against a team who hadn't conceded a single goal in their previous four games, it was suicidal. In response Moyes' side produced next to nothing. Chory Castro brought a save from Atletico's Slovenia keeper Jan Oblak which was comfortable enough, while Sergio Canales swung a leg at a dropping ball from inside the area, only to see it fly well wide. That was about all they managed until a free kick from one-time QPR midfielder Estaban Granero forced Oblak into his first stretching save with three minutes to play. The champions, on the other hand, without looking particularly good, continued to threaten, helped repeatedly by Rulli and his defenders, who seemed desperate to offer chances out of nothing. Mario Suarez was given the freedom of the penalty area from another corner, but couldn't make contact with his volley, before Rulli misjudged a wayward Koke cross, allowing it to land on his crossbar. ______ The win means Atletico are only two points behind city rivals and Champions League quarter-final opponents Real Madrid, although Carlo Ancelotti's side have a game in hand, and the defence of their title is not yet over. Diego Simeone was able to rest Fernando Torres for the final 30 minutes, after the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker had run hard, without much success, alongside Griezmann.

The forward's treble - his first in two years - clinched a pulsating 3-3 draw with their drop rivals as Villa edged further clear of the bottom three. Villa are three points above the Barclays Premier League drop zone and denied QPR the chance to leapfrog them in the table. Christian Benteke scored a stunning hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers . Manager Tim Sherwood said that Benteke can fire Villa to Premier League safety . Defeat would have left Villa in the relegation zone and behind QPR but Benteke struck a 25-yard free-kick with seven minutes left to save them and complete his treble. ______ He said: 'That's the plan. 'It doesn't come much better than that. He's a good player, I have always said it and he's in a rich vein of form. 'It's fantastic for him to score the goals, it's just a shame we couldn't get the three points. 'It's not about what you deserve, it's about what you get and we got one point. 'This could be a vital point come the end of the season in the end, when you go so late into the game and Christian has had to pull that out the bag we're grateful.' But Sherwood insisted Villa should have won after Benteke's first-half double, cancelling out Matt Phillips' opener, gave them a 2-1 lead at the break. He said: 'It's disappointing when you dominate a football match like that, the ref should have stopped it at half-time. QPR were only ahead for three minutes in the first half after Benteke equalised for the hosts at Villa Park . Benteke drove beyond Rob Green from the edge of the box to net his seventh goal of the season early on . 'I thought we tired in the second half but that's to be expected and two of those back four have trained about four times in eight weeks. We dropped off a little bit too deep and couldn't keep that pressure on them. 'But anyone who has seen that football match knows it shouldn't have been close.' Rangers hit back after the break through Clint Hill and Charlie Austin, the latter netting with just 12 minutes left. They have taken four points from their last two away games after winning just once on the road this season before Saturday's 4-1 win at West Brom. The draw, though, left them two points from safety having played a game more and boss Chris Ramsey admitted he was nervous after Austin's goal. He said: 'It's a long time, it's heart attack time for managers that. You can see you're going to win but you know there's a chance anything can happen, a free-kick, a corner or a bit of magic. Benteke's added two more, including this wonder free-kick - much like Jason Puncheon's on Monday night . 'I thought we could (hang on) but a free-kick is a free-kick, at that stage most of their attacking options had been exhausted. 'I'm disappointed if I'm being honest. But before the game if someone said we'd get four points from the last two games we probably would have taken that.' Rangers were seeking back-to-back away wins in the top flight for the first time since 1995 but Ramsey targeted home victories to keep them up. They host Chelsea on Sunday before welcoming West Ham and Newcastle to Loftus Road. He said: 'I don't know what we need but we're probably going to have to win three games. I don't know what the points total will be but our two home games are going to be very important after Chelsea. 'We have got a couple of very difficult ones in Liverpool and Manchester City and then we have the potential cup final against Leicester on the last day of the season. 'Most teams would take being in it right to the end and then roll the dice, you don't want to start being detached because it's a big mountain to climb.'",The Belgium international has seven goals in seven games under Sherwood and the boss hopes he can maintain his form to keep Villa up.,"* Benteke did not score four goals against QPR, he scored a hat-trick in the Aston Villa 3-3 draw with Queens Park Rangers.",0.8454167247,0.8620997071,0.8536766768,0.2083333333,0.0,0.1666666667,0.1666666667

Asked if he thinks he has had little of that so far, he told The Guardian: 'Honestly, yes I do. 'I don't feel like I've had a proper crack at it yet. 'I played the back-end of last summer against India, did okay without setting the world alight - and since then, it has been the odd game, coming in, dropping out again.' Hales was his own critic, after making an encouraging 40 on debut in Cardiff. Since the series against India last August, Hales has played in only five of England's subsequent 18 matches . He admitted back then, before his second innings, that India's seamers had limited his strokeplay, claiming: 'They were just very cunning. Once I got past 30, they were one step ahead of me. 'So it's up to me to put that right, and have that game smartness.' Nonetheless, he takes issue with the theory that he has been 'worked out' already at ODI level. He added: 'I read the press and saw the stuff about 'bringing the ball back in' and that I had been worked out - I got bowled once by Bhuvneshwar Kumar with an inswinger. 'That's not being worked out - that's a good delivery.' Nottinghamshire big-hitter Hales was run out last Sunday as his county battled to draw against Middlesex . Moeen Ali was preferred at the top of the order, alongside Cook in the series defeat in Sri Lanka and then with Ian Bell at the World Cup. 'Getting the news at the start of that Sri Lanka tour that I wasn't going to get first crack dented my confidence quite a bit,' said Hales. 'Maybe I let it affect me in a negative way. 'I am still learning my game, but I would definitely not say I have been ""worked out"".'","The big-hitting top-order batsman has nine England caps to date, since his debut against India last August.

257900,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,5373,2,5,"Rafa Benitez is what he is; an excellent cup manager. He proved this yet again on Thursday, when his Napoli side blitzed past Europa League favourites Wolfsburg by four goals to one on the Germans' home turf. But despite managing some of the continent's most established clubs since leaving Valencia just over a decade ago - Liverpool, Inter, Chelsea (albeit on an interim basis) and Napoli - he has amassed a grand total of zero league titles. Benitez famously guided Liverpool to the Champions League in 2005 as he enjoyed cup successes . Benitez remains popular at Anfield, but when he left there were few regrets over his departure . Donovan Chandler is a Liverpool fan writer on 90min.com . At Anfield, we will be eternally grateful for the Champions League trophy he delivered in 2005, in spite of possessing what was, on paper at least, our worst accumulation of players in recent history. Djimi Traore, Antonio Nunez, Milan Baros and Igor Biscan - cult hero that he was - were all part of that unfathomably successful squad. All four were dispensed of either that summer or the one that followed. Two years after Instanbul, Benitez was (almost) at it again with a side that better resembled the one he would have wanted, though it wasn't quite good enough to overcome an improved AC Milan side on this occasion. For all the Spaniard's successes, he also brought in the hapless Djimi Traore and Czech forward Milan Baros . And although we ran Manchester United a close second two seasons after that, we actually ended up further away from the Premier League title than we had been in a number of years during his final campaign (2009-10) - a failure that signalled the end to an Anfield tenure that also yielded our last FA Cup. In between, he lumbered us with the Josemi's, Albert Riera's and Phillipp Degen's of this world; none of us had many regrets over his departure - except, of course, that it was the catalyst for our introduction to Roy Hodgson. Benitez won the FA Cup with Liverpool in 2006 on penalties against West Ham . With Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard playing well together, Benitez got close to the title, but never won it . And for all his moments, I fully believe we are on the right track again under Brendan Rodgers, even if we can't quite clutch that final Champions League spot this season - or miss out on the FA Cup. That's why, if Rafa returns to England again in the summer - as is being speculated due to Napoli's Serie A shortcomings this season - it will receive little more than a shrug from large sections of the Kop. His league failings mean he is unlikely to be sworn in at any of our top-four rivals, unless Manchester City need someone to keep the seat warm for their dream conquest Pep Guardiola. Liverpool's failure in the Premier League means that Benitez will always be remembered as a cup specialist . ______ A sudden influx of largely Spanish-based signings would bring (mostly temporary) excitement and they'd probably do well in the cups - enough to banish memories of the Big Sam years at least. That's where Rafa excels; Europa League success at Stamford Bridge and triumph in the Coppa Italia last term are further testament to this. But a threat to us and where we want to be? It would only be a result of our own self-destruction. Good luck, Rafa. And thanks for the memories.","As far as my uneducated eyes can see, someone like West Ham would be the best place for your money, if you're that way inclined.",A famous quote also famous alludes to the success achieved some time ago by another manager as an example to describe another top flight team's hopes of winning a title as set to lead.,0.8268761039,0.8223897219,0.824626863,0.0983606557,0.0,0.0655737705,0.0655737705

The ‘noisy neighbours’ of Manchester City have spent more and won more. And the Sir Alex Ferguson factor vanished from Old Trafford when he retired in 2013. In fact the last time United won a derby at home was in 2011 when Wayne Rooney’s late spectacular acrobatic goal earned them a 2-1 victory. Wayne Rooney scored a spectacular overhead kick as Manchester United beat Manchester City 2-1 in 2011 . ______ Meanwhile City players look crestfallen during their 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Easter Monday night . But there has been a sudden and surprising shift this season. United have forced their way above City in the Premier League table for the first time since November 2013, and should Louis van Gaal’s red-hot team beat their suddenly-fragile rivals on Sunday afternoon, they will move four points clear of the defending champions. For many, then, the natural balance of power will have been restored. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is no longer trying to hide the collapse of his side’s season, which has seen them slip to fourth and make an early exit from three cup competitions, including the coveted Champions League. Having defended his side earlier following losses at Burnley and Crystal Palace, the Chilean has decided to be more candid ahead of the derby. ‘It has not been a good season, definitely not a good season,’ he said. ‘It was not so bad until the end of 2014, we were top of the table and still in the Champions League. But in the last three months, we have thrown it into the garbage, all that we did earlier. We are doing some things very badly, that’s why we must improve.’ Admitting there is a problem is always the first step to recovery but Pellegrini, who has won his last three games against United, appears a little less sure about how to fix it. City boss Manuel Pellegrini has branded the last three months of their season as 'garbage' due to poor form . The Chilean (left) cut a frustrated figure during City's 2-1 defeat at Palace on Easter Monday night . His players have been derided as an ageing first-team squad. Fifteen of them are 29 or over, including captain Vincent Kompany, who is experiencing his worst season at City. But Pellegrini will not go along with such a theory, saying defensively: ‘I don’t think the best players at the end can suddenly grow old in three months.’ Nonetheless, he clearly believes City must flex their financial muscles again to replenish the squad, just as they did in 2008 when the new Abu Dhabi owners broke the British transfer record within 24 hours of their arrival to sign Robinho for £32.5million. Since then, they have spent £500m on transfer fees. ‘I will try to continue being noisy,’ said the Chilean, referring to Ferguson’s famous quote about City in 2010. ‘All the big teams spend a lot of money, always. People just talk about it when it’s City.’ The problem for Pellegrini is that United are back in the game, competing for the top players following a brief post-Fergie wobble. United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who has overall responsibility for the budget, is determined his club will not be bullied out of deals as they were when City beat them to Samir Nasri, from Arsenal. Pellegrini wants City to flex their financial muscle in this summer's transfer market to bolster their squad . City pipped rivals United to the signing of Samir Nasri (right) from Arsenal in August 2011 . Van Gaal, after five consecutive Premier League wins, is equally bullish, declaring: ‘I don’t have any doubt that players are coming to Manchester United.’ Negotiations for Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels and Ilkay Gundogan are understood to be under way but the acid test will be for Juventus and France star Paul Pogba, 22, rated the best young midfield player in Europe and coveted by United and City. Both will throw money and the promise of titles at £60m Pogba, who began his career at Old Trafford but was allowed to leave for Serie A after a rare error of judgment by Ferguson. City say there are mitigating factors why they are a point behind United. David Silva thinks United’s absence from the Champions League has helped them. ‘It doesn’t surprise me United are doing well, they have had the advantage of only having the Premier League to play for, just as Liverpool did last season,’ said the Spaniard. ‘It will be a hard game for us but we can definitely win.’ The future of Pellegrini will come under huge scrutiny if he loses this match. He has been given some comfort by Van Gaal, who dismisses City’s last result, a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace, as a virtual fluke. Ilkay Gundogan (right) anchors Borussia Dortmund's midfield and could be brought by United in the summer . Mats Hummels (left) looks likely to join United this summer to strengthen their porous rearguard . Juventus' £60million-rated midfielder Paul Pogba is also a summer target for United and their rivals City . ‘I saw the game, watching on TV at home with a cup of coffee. Crystal Palace went 2-0 ahead but you could not imagine it was a 2-0 game,’ said the United manager. ‘We have also played these kind of matches. The opponents crossed the halfway line three times and they scored two goals but that’s football, and more so in England than in other countries. ‘Manchester City were unlucky and, of course, confidence is a big thing in football. But Sunday is another game, a special game and it shall not influence a lot.’ Rooney’s brilliant winner against City in 2011 was voted the best Premier League goal of all-time. The United captain still regards it as his favourite. ‘It was my best goal because of the importance of it. We won the game and soon after we won the title,’ he said. Should United win on Sunday, their supporters will dare to dream of such moments again. But if City can upset the odds and prove they are still a major force to be reckoned with, the noise will reverberate around Europe - and even reach Pogba. United manager Louis van Gaal believes City's defeat at Crystal Palace won't influence Sunday's derby . Expected team line-ups for the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon . So far Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has a 100 per cent record against United since he succeeded Roberto Mancini. Manchester City 4-1 Manchester United, September 2013 .

95701,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,1994,3,4,"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes recent defeats are down to his players' own failings rather than the opposition having cracked their system. The Reds' 3-4-2-1 formation, implemented from mid-December, helped produce a 13-match unbeaten Barclays Premier League run which lifted them to within a win of breaking back into the Champions League qualification places. But despite receiving plaudits for the quality of their football, which at times appeared to be unplayable, flaws started to appear a month ago when they were held to a goalless draw by Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn in the FA Cup. Brendan Rodgers says his sides recent defeats are down to his players, not his tactics being susses . After scraping a win against Swansea they were then exposed by Manchester United and Arsenal, two teams already in the top four. However, Rodgers insists a drop-off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents. 'I don't think it's about being worked out. We didn't start well (against Arsenal), and it doesn't matter what system you are playing if that happens,' he said. 'In the last four games that we've played we haven't created as much, and that's more on ourselves. Liverpool have lost ground in the race for the Champions League places and will find it hard to recover . 'Of course you give opponents credit but every team will go into a game to defend well and work hard against you. 'Probably the Blackburn game when we drew 0-0 and the games following that we haven't created as much. 'That's something that we want to reinforce - the creativity for chances and hopefully taking those chances. 'It's a difficult system to play against, but it's one of a number of systems we've played here and played very well. Alexis Sanchez fires home Arsenal's third goal, as the Gunners thrashed Liverpool at the Emirates . 'It's my job to always look to find the solutions, that's what I've tried to do in the games when we didn't look like scoring, finding a way to win.' ______ 'A trophy this season will mark another step forward for us. Getting to a final and winning a trophy is what we want. 'In terms of the FA Cup that was always an objective. 'On Wednesday, we'll look to reach our second semi-final of the season in the cup competitions (having been narrowly beaten by Chelsea over two legs).' With the play-offs out of reach for Rovers they will also be putting all their efforts into trying to reach a Wembley last-four encounter with Aston Villa. Jordan Rhodes (centre) can cause Liverpool's leaky defence a number of problems in the FA Cup replay . They showed enough on Merseyside a month ago to suggest they can trouble the Reds and, having dispatched top-flight sides Swansea and Stoke at Ewood Park, they will have no fear of Liverpool's arrival. 'Blackburn have got some excellent players. They defended well when they came to Anfield,' said Rodgers. 'We'll go there really focused and determined - we can't wait to play again after the weekend's disappointment.'","Blackburn, who host Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, will take heart from the Merseysiders' mini-slump at a crucial time of the season. For Rodgers and Liverpool though the cup now represents the only chance to save their season and that should guarantee a reaction at Ewood Park. 'It's important to have a game quickly when you lose,' added Rodgers. 'The group is very committed to winning this trophy but in order to do that you have to qualify and we know Blackburn will be a difficult game for us.

He was treated at King's College Hospital in south east London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation.

Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think ""It's never going to happen to me"". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves.

That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That’s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow’s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go… . Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third. Button, also on the soft compound, is faster than Alonso by four tenths, and he slots his McLaren into P7. The Briton comes over the radio to complain that the ‘rears are overheating’. Alonso is already donning the soft compound tyre. He comes across plenty of traffic on his fast lap, but still manages to go eighth… for now. So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is fired up, but there’s no problem with the world champion’s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap… . Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. ______ He is then alleged to have said: ‘I want a car. I’ve got a ticket.’ Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon’s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton’s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today’s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week’s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.",Security has been ramped up for this week’s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday’s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage.,"The three drivers that failed to make it through to the top-10 shootout with Lewis Hamilton in Shanghai are

Footage of Hummelstown police Officer Lisa Mearkle shooting two bullets into David Kassick's back as he lay face down on February 2 that was recorded by her stun gun has not been made public. Her attorneys asked a judge on Friday to bar the distinct attorney from releasing the video. Scroll down for video . Pennslyvania police Officer Lisa Mearkle is charged with criminal homicide in the shooting of David Kassick . Kassick, 59, was shot in the back while he lay face down on the ground on February 2. He was unarmed . Mearkle, 36, claimed she shot Kassick in self-defense because she saw him reach into his jacket for a weapon . A preliminary hearing to determine if there is enough evidence to send the case to trial is scheduled for Monday, CBS News reported. A lawyer working for Kassick's family who has seen the video, Christopher Slusser, said it 'leaves nothing to the imagination'. Mearkle is free on bail and suspended without pay . He said: 'Whether she would have been charged or not had the video not existed, I can't answer that,' 'But I can tell you having that video, for me - I won't speak for the DA - but it made it very clear the DA had very little choice not to charge her.' Mearkle, who is free on bail but is under electronic monitoring, is suspended without pay. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Marsico previously called the video the strongest evidence in the case when Mearkle was charged at the end of March. The stun gun's camera started recording when Mearkle, 36, used it on Kassick, 59, after she tried to pull him over for expired inspection and emissions stickers. Kassick sped away but she caught up to him after he got out and ran. Marsico said Kassick was trying to remove stun gun probes from his back when he was shot. Mearkle's lawyer, Brian Perry, said his client fired at Kassick in self-defense because she thought he was reaching for a gun. She performed CPR after the shooting. Kassick's family said he had struggles with drug addition but that he was not a violent person. A syringe was found near Kassick's body and he had alcohol and unspecified drugs in his system when he died. He was a construction worker. Dauphin County District Attorney Ed Mrisco (left) called video of the shooting the best evidence in the case . The offense of criminal homicide encompasses charges from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to murder . According to the arrest affidavit: 'At the time Officer Mearkle fires both rounds from her pistol, the video clearly depicts Kassick lying on the snow-covered lawn with his face toward the ground. ______ The motion filed by her defense team about the video is scheduled to be addressed on Tuesday. The offense of criminal homicide encompasses a range of charges, from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to felony first-degree murder. Prosecutors often narrow the charge later in the process, about the time when defendants are formally arraigned.","'Furthermore, at the time the rounds are fired nothing can be seen in either of Kassick's hands, nor does he point or direct anything toward Officer Mearkle.' Marsico planned to show the video on Monday, but Mearkle may waive the hearing.","Based on the given text:

The autopsy evidence on David Kassick that will be disclosed in a later hearing may include bullet fragments, blood analysis, and toxicology reports from potential overdose testing, which may help assess the nature of the fatal weapon in choice.",0.8396776915,0.8338502645,0.8367537856,0.2558139535,0.0,0.1395348837,0.1627906977

Liverpool's first-team players will be all smiles if they can finish inside the top four and win the FA Cup . Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling arrives at Anfield eight hours ahead of Monday night's match at Anfield . Dejan Lovren will be hoping to keep his place after appearing in Liverpool's win over Blackburn . Jordon Ibe removes a suit from the boot of his car as he begins to prepare for his side's league match . Liverpool are seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City but have a game in hand on their rivals . Had Manchester City won their games against Crystal Palace and Manchester United, talk of Liverpool being Champions League contenders would have been risible but the implosion at the Etihad Stadium has thrown things wide open. At present, the gap between Liverpool and City is seven points – and, just like last year when the two teams were duelling, Manuel Pellegrini’s side have a significantly better goal difference – but Rodgers will be telling his squad that it is not insurmountable. Given the way City are playing, there are a number of games that could cause them issues on the climb to the line – will Aston Villa and QPR be straightforward? How about Tottenham away? Does Pellegrini retain his squad’s belief? – and now is the moment Liverpool must pounce. In the next seven days, the way Liverpool’s campaign is viewed could be completely transformed. Beat Newcastle and they will believe they can hunt City down; see off Villa at Wembley and they will have a fine chance of winning the FA Cup. Rickie Lambert, pictured making his way into Anfield, has failed to hit the back of the net in his last six games . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be hoping his side can get back to winning ways in the Premier League . Sterling and his Liverpool team-mates were left dejected after their 4-1 defeat by Arsenal . So now the question will be asked of Rodgers’ squad: can they ramp up the pressure? There have been occasions this season when they have faltered at crucial moments – think home games against Basle (Champions League), Manchester United (Premier League) – and there can be no repeat. Here lies an opportunity for Raheem Sterling to dispel the furore around his contract saga with some jet-propelled performances, for Daniel Sturridge to remind a wider audience of his goalscoring ability and for Philippe Coutinho to sparkle and shine. Coutinho has won John Terry’s vote to be the player of the year. It was quite a statement from the Chelsea captain but there is little doubt that the Brazilian has the ability to be one of the top draws in the Premier League. These two games should be made for him. If Coutinho starts pulling the strings against Newcastle, Liverpool will get the result that will ensure Manchester City feel their breath on their necks and you would think the wide open spaces of Wembley would be tailor-made for his passing game. Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho helped his side progress to the semi-finals of the FA Cup . Rodgers talks tactics with his coaching staff ahead of his side's Premier League showdown with Newcastle . ‘He is a young player that's come into this country and adapted incredibly well to the style of football in the Premier League,’ said Rodgers. ‘People initially maybe thought he might be a bit slight. But he is very strong in his mind and he’s got an incredible technique, up there with world's best. 'With him it's about the consistency. He played in a different position the other night against Blackburn, we asked him tactically to operate different and he carried that out very, very well. So great tactical discipline and obviously a wonderful goal. ‘His best years are way ahead of him. He's such a humble boy, he wants to train and loves his football every day. John's probably looking at his performance level; since he's been here it has been outstanding and is only going to get better which is the pleasing thing for everyone.’ Rodgers’ ambition all year has been to win a trophy. If he was also to steer Liverpool into a top-four spot, it would arguably represent an even better campaign than last year when they came within two points of ending their 25-year quest to become champions of England. To realise that ambition, however, Rodgers needs two wins. A door has been left ajar and Coutinho is the man to lead Liverpool through it.","From looking as if a door had been slammed shut on them, Liverpool, unexpectedly, have a chance to kick it back open and capitalise. When Liverpool’s players trudged from the Emirates Stadium pitch, having been pummelled into submission by Arsenal, all hope of a top-four finish looked to have evaporated. Brendan Rodgers, subdued and disconsolate, admitted as much in his post-match debrief. The Rodgers who left London nine days ago is very different, though, to the Rodgers who will step into Anfield’s technical area on Monday, feeling optimistic and satisfied with his lot.",Manchester City are looking strong following a recent 2-1 win in the Premier League against Manchester United,0.8496329784,0.8163020611,0.8326340914,0.0695652174,0.0,0.0695652174,0.0695652174

The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past.

Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him.

Luna's lawyer, Jim Berry, made a shock admission in court on Tuesday that his client had fired the bullet that killed Lane but added the teen was 'reckless' and was only trying to 'scare the jogger'.

The once-capped Spain striker has spent a frustrating season on loan at Napoli where injury has seen him make just five appearances for Rafa Bentitez's Serie A giants. Michu scored 22 goals in his first season at Swansea after signing from Rayo Vallecano for £2.2million in July 2012 and broke into the Spain squad, but two injury-riddled campaigns since have raised doubts about his future in south Wales. Garry Monk will hold talks with Michu, pictured in 2013, before making decision on Spaniard's future . Michu recently said he did not know whether he would be returning to Swansea after his spell at Napoli . The 29-year-old told Spanish newspaper Marca last week he did not know whether he would be returning to Swansea this summer to see out the final year of his contract - and Monk was also giving few clues when the subject was raised ahead of Everton's Barclays Premier League visit on Saturday. 'I'm sure we will make contact with Michu before the end of season,' Monk said. 'But we'll let his season finish and our season finish before we sit down at some point to discuss the future. 'I know he's had a difficult time with injury and his concentration right now is on getting back to fitness. ______ 'But he's coming back to full fitness now and hopefully he will have a good end to the season there. 'I've got a good relationship with Michu, we were team-mates before I became manager, and I was fine with how he wanted to go. 'I've kept an eye on him and it's our duty as a club to understand what's exactly going on with Michu on a game to game basis. 'He hasn't had a sustained period where he's been fit and it's always hard as a player when that happens. 'He's been unfortunate, but if he get can a sustained period of fitness I'm sure you'll see the quality we've seen here.' Monk has heaped praise on Bafetimbi Gomis following the striker's recent fine goalscoring form . One player who has been fit and firing, however, is French striker Bafetimbi Gomis who has scored three goals in his last two appearances as Swansea have recorded back-to-back wins over Aston Villa and Hull to move within a single point of their best Premier League haul with seven games still remaining. Gomis had a difficult first half to the season playing second fiddle to Wilfried Bony but the Ivorian's initial £25million sale to Manchester City has seen him become the club's first-choice striker and he has grasped the opportunity in recent weeks. 'When Wilfried left and he was starting games Bafe was probably too eager to do well,' Monk said. 'His effort and commitment have always been great but he was trying too hard to score goals. 'He's kept that effort and commitment but he's probably more relaxed now, he's showing his composure in games now and that is vitally important.'","'He'll want to finish the season off strong there and I'll speak to him in the summer. 'I'll get his side of things and where he wants to take his future and I'll assess it from my side as well.' Monk has been keeping a close eye on Michu during the Spaniard's loan spell at Italian outfit Napoli .

The statue will be positioned on the recently opened Celtic Way and will represent a man who is synonymous with the club and someone who represented them with true distinction as both a player and manager. As a player, McNeill won nine consecutive league championship titles, seven Scottish Cups, six League Cups and, of course, he was the first British team captain to lift the European Cup in 1967. Celtic legend BIlly McNeill poses with the European Cup to commemorate the club's famous 1967 victory . He was named the Scottish Footballer of the Year in season 1964-65, the first ever winner of the award. As manager, McNeill delivered four league championship titles, three Scottish Cups and he lifted the League Cup once. As both player and manager, he enjoyed a 27-year association with Celtic Football Club. Fittingly, the work on the statue will be carried out by John McKenna, the sculptor who recently completed the statue of Jock Stein which sits at the entrance to Celtic Park. Work on the statue of McNeill will begin immediately and it is hoped that the completed work will be unveiled at Celtic Park later this year, around Autumn.

But if they do manage to take three points from Turf Moor, Arsenal will still be on target to match their best ever winning streak in the Premier League era by the time the season is over. ______ United sit second on the list, having put together a 12-game winning run under Sir Alex Ferguson between March and August 2000. Their storming end to the 1999-00 campaign ensured the Red Devils comfortably won their sixth Premier League title, with second-placed Arsenal finishing a massive 18 points behind them. Chelsea's longest winning streak stands at 11 games between April and September in 2009 as interim boss Guus Hiddink and his successor, Carlo Ancelotti, helped the Blues hit top form. Liverpool put together their best run of form last season as they stormed towards their first Premier League title before faltering in two of their final three games. Aided by the goals of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, Brendan Rodgers' side also managed 11 straight wins between February and April before losing 2-0 at home to Chelsea. Manchester City were just one victory away from equalling their best run of eight straight wins earlier this season but they couldn't quite manage to repeat the feat they managed between December 2013 and January 2014. The Gunners hold the record for the most consecutive victories - winning 14 games to clinch the title in 2002 . Manchester United's winning streak of 12 games helped Sir Alex Ferguson's men to the title in 1999-00 . Chelsea striker Demba Ba slides the ball home at Anfield to end Liverpool's 11-game winning run last season . Everton also put together their best ever run in the Premier League last season, earning seven wins on the bounce between March and April last year as they tried and failed to break into the top four. Newcastle won seven straight games in 1996, while Tottenham managed one less in the last three months of 2011. Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Southampton, Sunderland and West Ham all have a best winning run of five games in the Premier League era, with Hull, Leicester, Stoke, Swansea and West Brom all managing four victories in succession.

The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted.

Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria’s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Julián Cuesta in the visitors’ goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Barça number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria’s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi’s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta’s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta’s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Barça and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo’s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta’s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria’s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona’s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona’s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury.

For the young midfielder, a Parkhead title party next month would also help make up for the hurt he suffered at the very same venue 12 months previously. Last May, at the culmination of an exciting season on Tayside, Armstrong and his young Dundee United team-mates harboured high hopes of becoming just the third team in Tannadice history to lift the Scottish Cup. Celtic's Stuart Armstrong (right) is hoping to get his hands on the Scottish Premiership title . Armstrong completed a move from Dundee United to Celtic during the January transfer window . Following a 2-0 defeat in the final against St Johnstone, however, the 23-year-old was left crestfallen as he watched the Perth side celebrate their own slice of history on the Parkhead turf. A year on and he is part of a Celtic side rapidly closing in on a title that even Derek McInnes, manager of closest challengers Aberdeen, admits is essentially over. While insisting nobody at Celtic is taking league glory for granted, Armstrong – who joined Celtic on transfer deadline day - admits that a title party in the east end of Glasgow next month would represent a green day to banish the blues that still hang over his head from a year ago. ‘Last year’s Scottish Cup Final at Celtic Park was a disappointing end to a very enjoyable season,’ Armstrong recalled ahead of his side's lunchtime clash at Inverness. ‘We had the joy of winning the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers at Ibrox so to then go on and lose in the final to St Johnstone was very difficult to take. It’s not something you can change, though, so you have to just live with that disappointment. ‘But winning the title would be nice this year. A bit of success would certainly lighten the disappointment of that cup final. ‘And there’s a nice little gap building now at the top of the table. For a while Aberdeen were threatening us closely but we have managed to extend the gap and we still have a game in hand. While it’s never over until it’s mathematically impossible, we are confident we can clinch it. But we won’t be complacent. Armstrong joined Celtic along with his close friend and former Dundee team-mate Gary Mackay-Steven . ‘I’ve been here at Celtic a few months now and I’ve played a few games so I do feel like a Celtic player. But I would feel even more like a Celtic player with a league winners’ medal. As a player, you want to fill your trophy cabinet up and winning the league title would be a great way to start.’ In this season when achieving just the fourth treble in Celtic’s long history is a real possibility, Armstrong, like close friend Gary Mackay-Steven, has been limited to Premiership action because of his involvement in the cups with United earlier this season. ______ In particular, he feels walking out to a wall of sound at Parkhead against Inter Milan in the Europa League in February will have left himself and Mackay-Steven ready to hit the ground running in the Champions League qualifiers in July. ‘It would be bizarre to maybe only be part of one part of a Treble - but it’s also exciting to be part of a team who are capable of doing it,’ he said. ‘I’d have loved to have been involved in all the big matches but that’s just the way it is. As it is, we have the chance of the title this year – and I’m sure there will be chances for other medals next year. ‘But I definitely feel part of it at Celtic now. Myself and Gary have settled in really well. It was nice people were saying myself and Gary were worthy of being in contention for Scotland but it was nice to get away to Dubai for a few days of sun during the international break and to come back fresh. Even if it felt wrong not having my friend Gary there in Dubai with me, since we’re always together! Kris Commons scored in Celtic's recent Scottish Premiership 2-0 win over Partick Thistle . ‘But being in Dubai to relax let me reflect on everything that’s happened since January. Yes, it’s a little frustrating not to be involved in the cup matches because they are always exciting games. But the advantage of coming in January was that by the time the qualifiers come round next season I will look forward to them rather than be nervous. ‘The Inter Milan game was an eye opener as to how big the support is and how noisy the ground can be. To play against a huge team like them – and for me to do so well – was a great experience and I can’t wait for next season.’ Inverness-born Armstrong played for Caley Thistle for a season as a 16-year-old before his family uprooted for Dundee and he joined up at Tannadice. While he has few ties left in the Highlands, he is full of respect for John Hughes’ side and his friend from the youth team, current Caley Thistle captain Graeme Shinnie. ‘I grew up in Nairn but I was born at Raigmore Hospital,’ he said. ‘We lived up there for six or seven years when I was young and I’ve still got family in Nairn. ‘I also played for Inverness Under 16s for a year before we moved to Dundee. The likes of Graeme Shinnie were there with the Under 19s and Terry Butcher was in charge, with Charlie Christie involved training the youth sides. ‘But I didn’t play particularly well at Inverness. I became a better player after I went to Dundee United.’","His League Cup-winning team-mates return to Hampden next Sunday to face Inverness in the Scottish Cup semi finals and, while being on the outside for cup ties is undeniably frustrating, Armstrong believes arriving in January has been of huge benefit in other ways.",Stuart Armstrong participated in the Inter Milan game against part of his regular Champions League qualifying schedule in July.,0.8439939618,0.8314002752,0.8376497626,0.21875,0.0322580645,0.125,0.125

United are third, eight points behind leaders Chelsea, who they face on Saturday and play second placed Arsenal in their penultimate league game. Smalling scored United's fourth goal in their 4-2 derby demolition. It means he has now scored the same amount of Premier League goals this season as former teammate Danny Welbeck at Arsenal with four. Chris Smalling showed his hunger to beat a lethargic City defence to Ashley Young's free-kick . Smalling is greeted by Juan Mata following his goal in Manchester United's impressive win over their rivals . He said: 'It’s massive [to win six in a row]. I think a lot of people probably saw our fixtures as the hardest of the lot, but if you play teams like Tottenham and Liverpool and win, they’re real six-pointers. It makes a massive difference, and I think confidence comes from beating these top teams. 'We weren’t ourselves in the first 15 minutes, but we dominated from there on. 'We came in at half-time and Giggsy said it was a good show of character to come back from a goal down, but in the second half we needed to get the ball down and take a few more risks. ______ 'I think today put us up another step and I think we’re on a roll; we can look up the table and not behind us. 'You could sense even from the warm-up that the atmosphere was going to be special. We lost against City earlier in the season so today was massive and I think the fans really stuck with us.' All of United's outfield players celebrate as they gave noisy neighbours Manchester City .","Mata once again showed his value to the side and pointed the way with a display full of energy and poise . 'We were a bit cautious and didn’t try to play out [from the back] too much, but in the second half we really kicked on and made a print on the game. Smalling ghosted into the area unmarked to head Ashley Young's free-kick past Joe Hart on 73 minutes.

The struggling Barclays Premier League champions know they need more English players in their starting line-up — goalkeeper Joe Hart has often been the only one this season — and Liverpool’s Henderson and Arsenal’s Wilshere are deemed to be realistic targets. City also maintain an interest in Liverpool’s unsettled England forward Raheem Sterling, with 36-year-old veteran Frank Lampard set to leave and 29-year-old James Milner likely to follow him out of the Etihad Stadium. England midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) is a surprise target on Manchester City’s summer shopping list . Wilshere tries to cut inside during his appearance for Arsenal's Under 21 side on Tuesday night . Liverpool's Jordan Henderson is another surprise name among targets of Manchester City for this summer . Manchester City also maintain an interest in Liverpool's unsettled forward Raheem Sterling . Henderson, 24, has come to City’s attention because he has only one year left on his Liverpool contract. Their concern about Wilshere, 23, who has over two years left on his Arsenal deal, is his injury record. He has yet to return to Arsene Wenger’s side since having surgery on his troublesome left ankle in November. There is a well-trodden path between Arsenal and City over the past five years. The Manchester club, who offer far bigger salaries, have spent £80million on Samir Nasri, Bacary Sagna, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Toure and Gael Clichy.

She is also co-chairman of Reading Football Club with Madejski. Lady Sasima Srivikorn is in her 70s with an endearing laugh and a royal blue scarf she has knitted especially for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at Wembley. Like 73-year-old Madejski, Lady Sasima is something of an eccentric. Educated at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama in the 1950s, she has been a singer and composer who wrote the theme song for the Asian Games. 'It was called Reach For The Stars,' she says proudly before talking enthusiastically about her involvement with the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra and her autobiography, A Life By Chance. Reading co-owners Lady Sasima Srivikorn and Sir John Madejski spoke to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton . The Championship club will swap the Madejski Stadium for Wembley on Saturday in the FA Cup semi-final . But then she offers a chilling insight into what it is to be one of Thailand's most powerful women, a super-rich Harvard Business School graduate who became the first female on the Thai Airways board. Madejski listens intently as the woman he credits with rescuing Reading last September talks about the night in 2014 when three men armed with M16 automatic weapons fired on her house in north-east Thailand. She believes the incident was provoked by the political activities of her daughter and son-in-law. The previous day they had instigated a peaceful public demonstration after seeing the former wife of Thaksin Shinawatra — ex-Thai prime minister and one-time owner of Manchester City — in a Bangkok shopping mall. Shinawatra was removed from power in 2006 in a military coup after allegations of corruption. Jamie Mackie celebrates after scoring Reading's third goal against Bradford to secure their victory . Reading beat Bradford 3-0 in a quarter-final reply at the Madejski to secure their Wembley semi-final . Lady Sasima says her daughter was still angry about the corruption, explaining: 'The next day I am with friends at my house. We had been playing cards until about 2am. We had just gone to bed. And I had 100 bullets from an M16 shot at my house. 'They didn't mean to kill. They just wanted to scare, to threaten, but bullets hit my bathroom. The windows in my bedroom.' Presumably she now goes everywhere under armed guard? 'No,' she says. 'There's no use having security. If someone really wants to kill me, they can kill me any time. It's funny, when I realised it was a machine gun I thought it was the moment when I was about to die but I was very calm, not frightened at all.' 'This is one hell of a wise lady — and very modest too,' says Madejski admiringly. When I first saw Lady Sasima at the hotel at the Madejski Stadium, she was seated at the head of a table having breakfast with five Thai gentlemen. One was Pairoj Piempongsant, who brokered the deal when Shinawatra bought City in 2007 and is now senior adviser to the four-strong Thai consortium that purchased Reading last year. 'In business I'm probably more comfortable with men. I find them more straight-forward,' she explains now she is in the Lady Sasima Suite that boasts a perfect view of the pitch. Reading players mob goalscorer Garath McCleary during their 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final win over Bradford . Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives the lowdown on Reading's players to watch ahead of the Arsenal match . 'The people you saw me having breakfast with are involved in politics. And you may have recognised Pairoj Piempongsant. He is a very nice man who has the knowledge and contacts we need.' As the owner of a 25 per cent stake in Reading, Lady Sasima is clearly not about to let Piempongsant run the show, however. 'I started in business when I was 25,' she says. 'My late husband's parents passed away and we had some money. We started with a school — which one of my daughters now runs — and then we had a hotel — but my biggest passion is land. I like real estate. I like to create things. It allows me to use my imagination.' She appears to be thinking along these lines with Reading. The consortium has already invested heavily in the club's academy, building 13 pitches. She says she is also in discussion with Reading Council and talks of a vision of 'a second London' along the M4 corridor. 'I love this town,' she says. For Reading FC the longer-term vision is clear. A club that has twice before been promoted to the Barclays Premier League want to return under manager Steve Clarke. 'That is the ambition,' she says and Madejski nods in agreement. ______ The cash the Russian was expected to invest when he bought Reading in 2012 never materialised and after a period Madejski described as the 'most stressful of my life', Lady Sasima and her colleagues stepped in. 'They have been like a breath of fresh air. I can't tell you how excited I am about the future,' he says. By his own admission Madejski needed to sell. He did a remarkable job with his hometown club, building the stadium as well as overseeing their rise to the top flight for the first time. But reports have suggested he lost the best part of £300million between 2008 and 2014 and he does not deny it. 'I'm not sure it was quite that much,' he says, 'but I lost a heck of a lot of dosh.' 'Not on football?' Lady Sasima asks, a little nervously. 'No, no,' says Madejski, with a laugh. 'An entrepreneur's life is cyclical. I'm just pleased we can now look forward in a positive way.' Reading man Hal Robson-Kanu battles with Bournemouth's Andrew Surman in the Royals' last game . Lady Sasima and Madejski are excited about Saturday and have a long-term ambition to get to the top flight . When it comes to Saturday evening's match, Reading's first FA Cup semi-final since 1927, this pair of septuagenarians — possibly the oddest couple in sport — are giddy with excitement. Lady Sasima talks of the 'honour' of playing Arsenal and the thrill of taking family, friends and business associates to Wembley. A man who has been defined by triumph over adversity, Madejski loves the fact that his team are underdogs. In 12 previous attempts they have never beaten Arsenal. Madejski talks movingly about being in foster care after his mother was ostracised by her family for a wartime fling that led to his arrival. 'Being illegitimate wasn't the most ennobling start,' he says. 'I feel sorry for my mother. She never really got over the fact of me. The pair are desperate to take their club back to the promised land of the Premier League . Reading boss Clarke has a tough test to come through on Saturday when his side face Arsenal at Wembley . 'I found out who my father was only 10 years ago. I never met him but his name was William Adshead. Quite ironic really when you think I became an ""ads head"" with the Auto Trader business. He was from Liverpool which is probably why I get on well with Cilla Black.' Now Lady Sasima is the one listening intently. 'I didn't know Sir John's story until after we bought the club,' she says, 'but he is a real gentleman. When my sons heard about me buying Reading they were all shocked. The first question they asked me was ""where is your business model?"" 'I said there isn't one. I don't think there can be in football. You just have to be passionate, dedicated and perhaps lucky. 'Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Everyone asks why? Why football? Why now? But you have this team that wins and loses. It's woken me up. Made me feel more alert.' Madejski gives her a squeeze. 'And it's fun,' he says.","Arsenal, pictured in training on Friday, will provide a tough test for Steve Clarke's Reading on Saturday .

But the home side’s lower order hung on — with Sulieman Benn batting as high as nine — and forced an unlikely draw. Stuart Broad celebrates with his England team-mates after taking the wicket of Kraigg Brathwaite . BRUISER BUTTLER .

The Yorkshire batsman was left with a nasty bruise but was fine to carry on. England's Gary Ballance receives treatment on the field after he was struck by a shot from Jos Buttler . ROOT IS SECURE . After Ballance and Ian Bell made centuries in the first Test, Joe Root’s 142-run contribution has been largely overlooked.

Joe Root plays a shot during his 142-run total on day four at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium . UMPIRE DAVIS STUMPED . Umpire Steve Davis dropped a bit of a clanger in the afternoon. Jason Holder bowled at Buttler’s leg stump and hit the batsman on the bottom of his left pad, earning an lbw call from Davis. Buttler reviewed the decision and to no-one’s surprise, DRS showed the ball was missing leg stump by so much it didn’t even pitch in line. Umpire Steve Davis dropped a bit of a clanger in the afternoon with his lbw call on Buttler . A BISHOO BLUNDER?

'That's just not his character. It's not.' As for Slager's wife, she said that earlier that day the two women had to go for a checkup together to see how her baby is doing. 'She was just so sad because he was not there and I know that he would not do something purposeful to not be able to be with his wife during the delivery,' Sharpe said of the doctor's appointment. 'They just tried so hard for this.' She then added; 'He has a little baby on the way, due next month, and they worked so hard for this baby.' The city had previously stated it would continue paying for Mrs. Slager's health insurance until she gives birth. Ms Sharpe also spoke about the Scott family as she said; 'Their life will never be the same again and my life will never be the same again. 'Even though they're not the same things that have happened, I know there are changes in both their family and my family ... and that's the part that bothers me. They've changed forever.' Ultimately, she is putting her trust in her faith, and refuses to believe that she might never see her son a free man again. 'I just have to let it be and hope God takes care of everybody involved -- not only my family but the Scott's family - because I know they're grieving just like I'm grieving,' she said. The shooting death of Scott by Slager occurred on Saturday morning . At the time, Slager said that Scott was going for his Taser and that he used necessary force . Video footage taken by an eyewitness soon refuted Slager's claims . Then, when asked about the video footage and if she had seen it yet, Sharpe said:  'No I have not and I have purposely not watched it.' She continued: 'I have purposely not heard people's comments about it. I just, I can't watch it.' She also said she is avoiding reading the papers of watching the news. 'I know who Michael is,' she explained. 'And I don't know what is being portrayed of him because I haven't listened to them, but he's a very good person.' Slager was charged with Scott's murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty.

Martinez was lauded by Everton fans last season as the club qualified for Europe with a fifth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League. But the going has been a lot tougher for the Spaniard in his second season on Merseyside with Everton having only removed the spectre of relegation by winning their last three matches. Garry Monk wants Swansea to continue their own impressive form with victory over Everton on Saturday . Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) scored twice for Swansea in their 3-1 victory over Hull last weekend . ______ 'It's just making sure you come through them and he's won the last three games, they're back on the up and he'll want to finish the season strongly. 'Of course they'd want to be pushing further up the league and it's not a position you'd associate with Everton. 'But if they can get back up to finish positively it will put a different twist on the season.' Everton have had to balance their domestic commitments with a demanding Europa League campaign which saw them knocked out at the round-of-16 stage last month. And Monk knows from Swansea being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on Premier League performances and results. 'Europe is tough, the travelling and constant games in certain periods,' Monk said. 'It all adds up and the intensity of the football at this level takes it out of you and takes its toll. 'Whether it (Everton's results) is all down to that I don't know, but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the Europa League, including ourselves, it has had an impact.' Swansea have never beaten Everton in the league but they claimed a point at Goodison Park in November after being reduced to 10 men following Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal. Martinez criticised Swansea's 'strange' tactics and style of play that day but Monk put it down to 'more frustration with his own side and not winning the game'. Roberto Martinez is hoping to continue Everton's form against his former team in the Premier League . Monk (right) holds no ill feeling towards Martinez, despite him criticising Swansea after defeat in November . 'It might have been a game they'd targeted to win and when it doesn't happen as a manager you do get frustrated,' said Monk, who knows victory will take Swansea past their previous best Premier League points total of 47. 'That's what it boiled down to. But we did well, we had Jonjo sent off so we were never going to go gung-ho and we got a good point. 'We did well in the circumstances and now we want to go one better and get all three.'","Ki Sung-Yueng (second right) also got on the scoresheet as Swansea maintained their impressive form . Vandals even defaced the outside of Goodison Park with 'Martinez Out' and 'Not Good Enough' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint, but Monk insists that is simply a part of modern-day football when results do not go your way.

The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish.

That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League. It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.'

Everton, Liverpool and Chelsea are three of the ten clubs who do not currently comply with the regulated size.

Tottenham's White Hart Lane is also one of the smallest pitches in the top-flight with parameters of 100m x67m . Former Stoke boss Tony Pulis insisted on using the minimum measurements allowed when the Potters were promoted to the Premier League back in 2008 in order to contain the opposition. The smaller pitch also benefited former midfielder Rory Delap, whose launched throws into the area led to a number of Stoke goals during the club's formative years in the top-flight. Back in 2011, Stoke were actually forced to extend the width and length of the pitch after qualifying for the Europa League. However, Hughes has completely overhauled the club's playing philosophy since taking over the Britannia Stadium hotseat in 2013 - the club are much less direct now -  and is set to expand the pitch by at least 15ft for next season.

Brendan Rodgers revealed Balotelli withdrew himself from the squad on Saturday and fell ill on Wednesday . Liverpool scraped through to a Wembley date with Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals thanks to Philippe Coutinho's strike. With 20 minutes remaining at Ewood Park, the Brazilian fired the ball across goal and past Rovers keeper Simon Eastwood. Click here to read Ian Ladyman's report . BT Sport pundit and former Blackburn midfielder Savage said: 'Pathetic isn't it? You're going to miss an FA Cup quarter-final?

Rodgers planned to use Balotelli for the FA Cup tie, but  admitted it was at the final moment his misfiring striker became unavailable. 'Mario travelled with us. He trained well, [but] fell ill last night,' Rodgers said ahead of the match which ended 1-0 to Liverpool. 'He stayed overnight with us in the hotel, [but] woke up still not feeling great. The doctors' advice was to send him back.' Balotelli's absence follows the Italian missing last Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Arsenal. The striker did not travel to the Emirates for the crunch clash after sustaining a hamstring injury in training on Friday. Rodgers said at the time: 'He trained on Friday afternoon with the team and he took a slight knock to his knee and he deemed himself not able to travel. 'I'm not a medic. He felt it was too sore to travel. The medical staff have looked at it. It was just something that he himself didn't feel comfortable enough to travel.'

Sergio Aguero struck after eight minutes to give City the lead but they were blitzed by United in a 4-2 loss . Despite Balotelli's gloating, the defeat for City is actually more beneficial to his Liverpool side . While United's blitz of City went on to leave the Italian red-faced anyway, the fact that a defeat for the champions was beneficial for his current club will not have gone unnoticed either. Instead, Balotelli seemed to throw his weight behind his former employers rather than clinging on to Liverpool's slim hopes of Champions League qualification that look like they will only open up if City's slump continues. ______ And with Manuel Pellegrini's side having lost six of their last eight in all competitions the Anfield club maintain a small chance of taking a top four place, even if it isn't at the top of Balotelli's list of priorities.

Spieth became the first player ever to reach 19 under par at Augusta and only a bogey on the 18th prevented him from adding the 72-hole scoring record to the 36 and 54-hole records he set on Friday and Saturday. The 21-year-old also became the second youngest champion behind Tiger Woods - whose 18-under total he equalled - after a closing 70 left him four shots ahead of Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson. Jordan Spieth admitted he would probably sleep in the green jacket after claiming his first major title . ______ Spieth poses in his green jacket having held his nerve in Sunday's final round in a start-to-finish victory . 1 Depending on which part of the internet you believe, the name Spieth comes from Middle High German and means either 'successful' and 'speedy' or 'late'. 2 Recently started the Jordan Spieth Charitable Trust, which focuses on special needs youth, military families and junior golf. It is inspired by his younger sister Ellie, who has autism. 3 Even world No 1 Rory McIlroy was impressed by the course-record 63 Spieth produced to win the Australian Open in December. 'You could give me another 100 rounds today at the Australian and I wouldn't sniff 63,' McIlroy wrote on Twitter. 4 Spieth is an occasional member of the 'money games' organised by Phil Mickelson in practice rounds before tournaments. 5 Won the John Deere Classic two weeks before his 20th birthday in 2013, thereby becoming the first teenage winner on the PGA Tour since 1931. 6 Is only the second player after Tiger Woods to have won the US junior amateur championship more than once. 7 Spieth rented two houses at the Masters, one to sleep in and the other to hang out with friends and family. 8 He won two and a half points from his four matches at the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles last year, losing to Graeme McDowell in the singles after being three up with nine holes to play. 9 One of his mentors is fellow Texan Ben Crenshaw, who played his final round after 44 consecutive Masters appearances on Friday after Spieth had set a new 36-hole scoring record at Augusta National. 10 As a four-year-old Texas Rangers fan, Spieth attempted to catch a stray ball at a game, lost it in the lights and had his two front teeth knocked out. 'I plan on not taking it off for a while,' Spieth said after being presented with the green jacket by 2014 winner Bubba Watson. 'I'll probably sleep in it for a few nights. 'It's the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It's a dream come true for me. I did not break 70 last year even having a chance to win so to shoot some low scores and hear those roars is very special. 'To join the club that is the green jackets and to join Masters history and put my name on that trophy and to have this jacket forever, it's something that I can't fathom right now. 'I saw my friends and family behind the green and knew it was a done deal. It did not kick in there and it still has not kicked in. I am still in shock a little bit. It was cool to share that experience with them because they have not been there the couple of times I have won.'

Rose got within three shots of Spieth three times on the front nine, but was left to rue mistakes on the eighth and ninth and a bogey on the 18th which cost him outright second. 'It was a great start for Jordan and myself with two birdies in the first three holes but the key moment for me was not getting up and down from right of the eighth and three-putting the ninth,' the former US Open champion said. Rose has led after the first round at Augusta three times and also finished fifth in 2007, and asked what he needed to do to win, added: 'Just shoot 14 under again. Normally that gets it done. Only thing I had not done was put four good rounds together and I did that so let's continue that trend.' Spieth had finished first, second and second in his previous three events and Rose added: 'Phenomenal, what a month of golf he's had.

195451,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,4072,1,5,"It's all Pep Guardiola's fault; him and the good folk of Scotland or, at least, St Andrews. ______ The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday . Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn't that the Barcelona team changed. Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them. What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews, where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola. There Messi was a distracted individual, sometimes sneering at Guardiola's insistence on organisation and pressing, according to Guillem Balague's account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola. But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics. The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing, sidling up to him after training, putting his arm round him to assure him of his support. Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi-final in his six years as a manager . Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics . Messi, the precocious star, suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola. And, as a result, he began to buy into Guardiola's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football, which was already a template at Barcelona. For tiki taka is not what made Guardiola’s team great. 'I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's rubbish and has no purpose.' It sounds like Sam Allardyce, but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by Marti Perarnau in his book Pep Confidential. What Guardiola added to Barcelona’s game was the intensity, drive and sheer energy which had wilted under Rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession. Sometimes, when assessing the English problem in Europe, it helps to reverse the question. So, rather than ask 'Why are we so bad now?' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005-2009?' Guardiola led Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011 (pictured) The former Barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success . For Chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph, that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of English clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier, bucking the established trend. Between 2005-2009 the Premier League provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the Champions League; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24. Even asking that question is revealing as what English clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy. Only Liverpool and Manchester United actually achieved that in the five-year period of English ascendancy, though, of course, Chelsea did so improbably in 2012. What was different about English clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the Premier League. Jose Mourinho may never have won the trophy with Chelsea but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win. Rafael Benitez was an extraordinary force, the Diego Simeone of that era, regularly out-witting Mourinho and taking a relatively normal Liverpool team to two finals. Guus Hiddink engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of Mourinho. Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 when English clubs were dominating the latter stages . Chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds . Rising to the challenge of Mourinho and Benitez, Sir Alex Ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period, playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before Guardiola and others made it fashionable. English teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope. What they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous. Benitez, Mourinho, Hiddink provided that and Ferguson responded. Put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which, allied to the commercial success of the Premier League, was pushing players and teams to new heights. The Premier League’s TV money of course brought in good, technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success. The money is bigger now and those players still come but it hasn't helped Manchester City. At the zenith of the Premier League's dominance, the 2008 Moscow final, ten English players started the game. Manchester City were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of Barcelona . Chelsea exited at the same stage as England have no representatives in the quarter-finals . When Jurgen Klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in Germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich - he explicitly referenced the Premier League and its pace. He recognised that continental Europe had fallen behind. It was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the English game which helped the Premier League dominate Europe. Conversely, it was Guardiola - and others, such as Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the Premier League. Clubs such as Barca, Bayern, Dortmund have retained their technical superiority over English clubs but they are now likely to out-run them and out-press them. In reality there is no one man responsible for that change. And, Guardiola's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for South American football and especially Marcelo Bielsa, rather than the Premier League. But when that change took place, the Premier League lost its competitive edge. And when Guardiola put his arm around Messi at St Andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game, European football changed forever.","It is a simplification, of course, but perhaps a useful way of understanding why, as we survey the Champions League quarter finals, there are no Premier League clubs troubling the scorers. Bayern Munich take on Porto on Wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben among others you might anticipate a sixth Champions League semi-final for Guardiola in his six years of management. Of course Guardiola isn't alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe; nor is it really down to St Andrews, though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs. Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto .","The quote not denied is: ""I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka.""

283285,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,5902,3,4,"MaiquetIa, Venezuela: it's a long way from Bundoran — and a long way from the Belfast homes of Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlan. The pair mischievously claimed that Donegal's seaside town was their destination of choice for a post-Olympic break following their respective bronze medal wins at London 2012, but they have certainly travelled far and wide during the current Olympiad. Barnes may have already been well known in Ireland prior to their achievements in London, but taking up his part in a charming double act with Conlan only endeared him further to a nation that unfortunately only flirts with the amateur version of the sport every four years before medallists appear on homecoming flights. Conlan (leff) lands a right jab on Matthew Martin during his bantamweight bout in Glasgow in 2014 . The reality of making that happen is far more complex, of course, and the efforts of Barnes and Conlan to make it to Rio 2016 are unprecedented. On Saturday night, the Belfast boys are potentially both one win away from qualifying for next summer's Olympic Games, with Barnes needing to ensure victory while Conlan must do likewise and depend on another result elsewhere. Their mission takes them to Maiquetia, northern Venezuela, where they will take on native opposition, the latest stop on the road-trip that is the World Series of Boxing (WSB) — a part of the convoluted new structure that once was 'amateur' boxing. WSB boxers are part of a franchise team, fighting individually over five three-minute rounds in a pro-style format. Barnes and Conlan box for the Italia Thunder team, but the sights and sounds of Milan and Rome were not what drew them to the competition. In fact, they have fought only three of their six bouts so far in Italy and while most WSB fighters receive payment, the Irish pair signed up with Olympic qualification as their sole motivation. Upon their return to Belfast after Saturday night's fight, they will have covered a distance of over 34,000 miles over the course of their various round trips. That is the equivalent of three trips from Dublin to Melbourne. They will have each fought seven fights in 13 weeks and, as of today, Barnes has boxed 29 rounds in 12 weeks to Conlan's 28. They are burnt out, peeved off and ready for rest — but only once their mission is complete Saturday night. Barnes is one victory away from qualifying for 2016 summer games in Rio . 'I just feel tired, I'm sick of it,' laments a worn-out Barnes, who is an undefeated 6-0. 'To fight every fortnight, travelling around the world, it's doing my head clean in. I'll be glad to get out of it. Hopefully I qualify and some good will have come from it. 'I was flying to Kazakhstan and I felt like crying on the plane, I felt like pulling out. I was very, very close. I think I was in Heathrow and I was going to get a plane back to Belfast. 'If I didn't qualify for the Olympics through this WSB, I'd have nothing to do with it. I've been training from November right through and then I'd need to go to the Europeans [Games] in June — I couldn't do that, like. ______ 'I'll not even be able to drink water, never mind a beer to relax, because I'll be making weight.' If he sounds like a touch grouchy, it is understandable. While their fixture list has included destinations as culturally and geographically diverse as Guba in Azerbaijan, Palermo, Poland's Konin, Almaty in Kazakhstan, Rome, Milan and now Maiquetia, the two-time Olympic medallist explains that they do not get to soak up the glamorous aspects of the cities. 'Far from it,' says Barnes. 'You go away and you have to go to the worst areas, there's nothing extravagant about it. It's not five star — it's one-and-a-half star. 'You can't really see too much because we're only there for a short period of time and when we get there we're training to make the weight… We're home the next day [after the fight] in the early hours. So we're more or less in and out.' Michael Conlan (left) and Paddy Barnes sport their bronze medals following their success at London 2012 . Adding to Barnes' stress is his constant struggle to make the 49kg light-flyweight limit. The 28-year-old has been boxing in the same weight division for 12 years and tales of his notoriously cranky pre-weigh-in demeanour are common, with Conlan witnessing the battle first hand as his regular room-mate. 'It does make it easier because we're mates outside boxing,' says Barnes of the benefits of being signed up to the same team as his pugilist pal. 'We're travelling together and fighting together so it is good, I'd rather that then going away on my own because I think I'd pack it in. It's too much of a strain. 'But when we're away, I barely talk to him because he knows I'm making weight!' Conlan, the laidback member of the double act, takes a far more carefree approach to travel. 'Getting on a plane doesn't bother me, if you're going to die on a plane, you're going to die,' laughs Conlan. 'A lot of the flights I try and sleep through so I'll be waking up in their [local] time.' The 23-year-old recently became a father, with his young daughter just four weeks old, while Barnes is also a father to a daughter of 11 months. The pair have also stayed neck and neck in terms of international achievements since Conlan emerged on the senior scene in 2011 and the younger member of the duo is also appreciative of his friend's presence on WSB duty. 'It's good for both of us because I know when I'm training with him, we're both training hard and pushing each other,' says Conlan. 'Everything we've done up until this WSB since 2012 has been the exact same — Olympic bronze, European silver, Commonwealth gold. The fact that this WSB has messed me up a bit is a bit unfortunate but we're still going well,' adds Conlan, who is in qualification limbo after two disputed 'away' points decisions, increasing the temptation to turn pro . 'Winning [tonight] isn't going to be a problem, I'm just waiting on other results. It's a bit of a sickener, but it has to be done at the end of the day. I have to get in there and do what I have to do and win, do my part of the job.' 'I'll try not to make any dramatic decisions after the fight if it goes against me, but I have a sharp tongue at times and say stupid things,' says Conlan. 'Hopefully it all works out. If it's meant to be, it's meant to be.' For Barnes, he maintains: 'The Olympic Games is what it's all about, it's every amateur boxer's dream and if I qualify, I'll be honoured to say I qualified for my third Olympic Games.'","I physically couldn't do that, it'd be impossible.' In addition to hand injuries, which have severely limited his training, Barnes has another battle he must overcome as he bids to become the first Irish boxer ever to reach a third Olympic Games. 'I hate flying, I just hate it, it depresses me even thinking about it. I can't even sleep, I'm that scared. I can't sleep, can't watch films, can't read books, I'm just too panicky, too nervous.","Here are five possible answers to the blot:

'When you're on bail you're under an obligation to appear, unless you're strapped to a bed on a drip,' Magistrate Malley said in court. Magistrate Malley pointed out that there was no legitimate conflict of appointment as court had been scheduled for a 10am start, whilst Cousins' appointment was not until midday.

If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge.' The first leg will take place under lights at the impressive, newly-opened 7,200-capacity stadium within the grounds of the £200m Etihad Campus, a sprawling complex aimed at kickstarting a conveyor belt of homegrown talent and defying those who claim the club have no interest nurturing growth from within. Wilcox believes those facilities, coupled with elite coaching, stand City in good stead when it comes to recruiting talent. Wilcox hopes to emulate Manchester United's 'Class of 92' but says it will be very difficult . 'We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea,' he said. 'It's up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I'm convinced once they see us it's very difficult to walk away from.' Will the final, between two clubs often criticised for spending millions of foreign players, be a chance to stick two fingers up to Football Association chairman Greg Dyke, who a year ago described the lack of English talent at Manchester City as 'pretty depressing'? Wilcox does not want to get into that. 'There’s a lot of media attention from Greg Dyke with regards to increasing the home-grown quota,' he said. Wilcox believes City's new Etihad campus will stand club in good stead when it comes to recruiting youngsters . A look inside one of the gyms at Manchester City's training complex . 'We can’t get embroiled in that because, for us, it’s a day-to-day question of how do we improve players? 'Proposals have already been put forward with regards to home-grown quotas. If he (Dyke) wants to increase it, then that is up to him. But whether you increase or lower the numbers, it doesn’t change the fact that you have to be good enough to get through.' Wilcox knows all about being good enough to get through at a club where money is no object. The Bolton youngster, who joined Blackburn at 14, was the only youth product to regularly appear in their Jack Walker-fuelled Premier League triumph in 1995. 'When I was a young player at Blackburn Jack Walker came in and brought Kenny (Dalglish),' he said. Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . 'You go two ways. Do I go elsewhere and take my chances or have I got stomach for fight and see what happens? Luckily for me I was the only homegrown player which was a great privilege. Now I'm passing my experience to younger ones.' Wilcox's arrival at Ewood Park came after rejection at none other than City. He remembers it well. 'I’d joined City at 13 and got released at 14,' he recalled. 'It’s quite fitting really because when I’m speaking to younger players I can always recall that chat if you like. ______ But to be told that it is tough for a young kid. But I just recall my own experience whenever I have to tell the lads and have the younger age groups. You have to go through some period in your life like that where not everything is going to go fantastically well.' Wilcox was one of the only graduate players to feature regularly for Blackburn during title-winning season . City manager Manuel Pellegrini will be at the Etihad Campus, as will England Under 21s chief Gareth Southgate. Things have not gone according to plan for the Chilean's first team this season, but does Wilcox believe their struggles have increased the pressure on his youngsters to deliver the club's only silverware this season? 'Not really,' he said. 'At the start of the year, irrespective of what was happening at first-team level, the FA Youth Cup was a chance for our players to be put in a situation where they are being put under a bit of pressure and I think it’s great that they are being put under a bit of pressure.' Aided by Wilcox's wise head, they appear to be thriving under it.",I think at that time it was a case of I just got told that they were not going to retain me on a year’s contract. 'It was devastating at the time. Everything was going really well.,"The correct sentence is:

105822,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l2,2205,0,3,"Wisden, the cricket bible, has launched a stinging attack on English cricket and says that the national team have lost touch with the game's public. Editor Lawrence Booth, also a respected cricket writer with Sportsmail, uses his notes to take England to task after a tumultuous year spent trying to recover from the bitter fall-out of losing the last Ashes series 5-0. English cricket, says Booth in the 152nd edition of the fabled Almanack, which is published on Wednesday, 'repeatedly lost touch with the basic idea that the national team belongs to us all'. Wisden editor Lawrence Booth has launched a stinging attack on the ECB's handling of Kevin Pietersen . The star batsman will ply his trade for Surrey in a bid to reclaim his spot in the England Test team . And he continues: 'A few wins might have deflected attention from a charge sheet that would include the mishandling of the Kevin Pietersen affair, worrying Test attendances outside London, a head in the sand attitude to the one-day team and - not yet a decade after the 2005 Ashes had presented English cricket with a golden chance to attract a new generation to the sport – a fall in the number of recreational players. 'Starting with the drubbing in Australia, England lost eight full series out of all across the formats in 2014, to say nothing of their defeat by the Netherlands at the World Twenty20. In all, they lost 28 games. Only once had this been surpassed in a calendar year by one of the eight major teams – the dysfunctional 2010 Pakistanis. 'National selector James Whitaker had called Cook ""our exceptional leader""; Paul Downton, the ECB's new managing director, hailed Peter Moores as the ""outstanding coach of his generation"". It was a nexus of self-preservation yet, as the wagons circled, the wheels kept threatening to fall off.' The Wisden editor is just as scathing about England's decision to sack Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the drink of what turned out to be the most disastrous World Cup in England's history. Peter Moores presided over a disastrous World Cup but was labelled 'the outstanding coach of his generation' by the ECB's new managing director Paul Downton . The beleaguered Alastair Cook was stripped of the one-day captaincy before the World Cup debacle . 'To leave the sacking of Cook so late made little sense,' says Booth. 'Had he stepped down in August after the 3-1 Test win over India he could have done so with his post-Ashes reputation partly restored. This would have allowed him to gather strength for the ludicrous run of 17 Tests in less than 10 months, starting in Great Optimism in Antigua in April 2015 and ending in Near Exhaustion in South Africa in January 2016. (As someone pointed out, 17 Tests are almost a third of Don Bradman's career.) 'Trouble was, Cook had become more than just a cricketer: cast by his employers in the role of latter-day saint to Pietersen's fallen angel, he was now an article of faith. Giles Clarke (the ECB chairman) even suggested the Cooks were ""very much the sort of people we want the England captain and his family to be"" which was all well and good but couldn't stop him edging behind. Downton, Whitaker and Moores were all bound up with his fate. Cook had to succeed, as much for others as himself. It was an intolerable position. 'England overplayed their hand. The Test win over a supine India did not mean Cook would effect a similar transformation of the one-day side. This seemed obvious to everyone – except to the men who run the game.' But Booth, who also writes for Sportsmail, says Cook's eventual sacking so late made little sense . National selector James Whitaker (right) had called Cook 'our exceptional leader' Pietersen appeared on the Graham Norton Show - the presenter suggested 'team sport's not for you' England also come under attack for the way they handled the sacking of Pietersen, a situation where they had right on their side - plus the support of the bulk of those who follow the team around professionally - but somehow allowed the maverick to claim the morale high ground. A situation that, incredibly, is still going on, after Wisden went to press on this year's edition. 'The ECB's comments on the fall-out with Pietersen should have been clear and concise,' writes Booth. 'If you're widely regarded as a pain it helps if you're scoring lots more runs than anyone else. Instead, England botched the PR battle. They hinted that some darker truth about his behaviour would emerge once a confidentiality agreement expired in October. Yet the lull merely prolonged the fiasco. And, when the dirt failed to materialise, the ECB looked rudderless. Worse, in the eyes of those agitating for an explanation, they looked indifferent. 'It was typical of a story beyond ECB's control that their best moment was not of their own making. Having searched in vain for the words that justified his sacking, they were gifted a 324-page solution, an autobiography so full of rancour that BBC chat-show host Graham Norton suggested to Pietersen: ""Maybe, just maybe, team sport's not for you."" This year's Wisden also includes both a withering review of Pietersen's nasty book by the Mail on Sunday's Patrick Collins, who retired this year after a distinguished career, and an excellent piece of the aspect of his career totally overlooked by Pietersen in his book – batting that touched genius. Simon Hughes admirably fills the void that Pietersen left himself. Gary Ballance has been named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year in the new edition . Ballance's Yorkshire team-mate Adam Lyth, called up by England, is also in the top five . Jeetan Patel (left) and Angelo Mathews make up the remainder of Booth's top five cricketers . Sri Lanka's brilliant Kumar Sangakkara clinched the title of leading cricketer in the world . Australia's Meg Lanning (batting against England) is honoured with the inaugural women's award . ______ Booth has chosen well and predictably in the cases of Moeen Ali, who has the honour of being pictured on the front cover, Gary Ballance, Adam Lyth and Angelo Mathews and enterprisingly in Jeetan Patel, who is rewarded for his prolific season for Warwickshire. To me, the award suffers in that players are only allowed to be picked once. For instance, how good would it be if, on his retirement, a player would be described as a five-time Wisden cricketer of the year? Booth is a progressive, brilliant, imaginative editor but perhaps such a move would be just a little too controversial for such a traditional vehicle as Wisden. The brilliant Kumar Sangakkara, who will be delighting championship audiences with Surrey this summer, is the leading cricketer in the world while, for the first time, there is an international woman cricketer of the year. Australia's Meg Lanning is honoured with the inaugural women's award. As ever, Wisden is a must for any cricket fan and even at a time of continuing turmoil for the England team and genuine concerns about cricket's future world-wise, it is a reassuring presence however critical the editor is of it. Moeen Ali (England and Worcestershire) England’s search for a spin bowler to replace Graeme Swann was thought to be doomed – until Moeen Ali lit up the summer with 12 wickets in the Southampton and Manchester Tests against India. He finished the series with 19 at 23 apiece. Earlier in the season he had almost saved the Headingley Test against Sri Lanka, batting for all bar one ball of the final day. And, when he was promoted to open for the one-day side, he scored the third-fastest hundred by an England batsman, from 72 balls against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Moeen Ali celebrates taking the wicket of India's Cheteshwar Pujara at Old Trafford last summer . Gary Ballance (England and Yorkshire) Gary Ballance began the summer with a century in his first home Test, against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, and followed up with two more against India – at Lord’s and Southampton. By the end of the season he boasted a Test average of over 60. Gary Ballance celebrates reaching his century during the third test with India in Southampton last year . Adam Lyth (England and Yorkshire) Yorkshire opening batsman Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the County Championship, with 1,489 runs at an average of 67 and six hundreds, and was one of the pillars of his team’s triumph. He was rewarded with a place on England’s tour of the Caribbean in April 2015. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the 2014 County Championship season . Angelo Mathews (Sri Lanka) Angelo Mathews was the inspiration behind Sri Lanka’s first Test series victory in England. After helping to save the First Test at Lord’s with a century, he made 160 – and took four wickets – as Sri Lanka came from behind to win in Leeds. Mathews also led his team to wins in the one-day series and the one-off Twenty20 international. Angelo Mathews after making 160 for Sri Lanka in the second Test with England at Headingley . Jeetan Patel (New Zealand and Warwickshire) New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel was central to Warwickshire’s success across all three formats. He claimed 107 victims in total, more than anyone in the country, and his 25 wickets in the NatWest T20 Blast – the most in the competition – helped his side lift the trophy on home turf at Edgbaston. Jeetan Patel takes the final wicket as Warwickshire beat Middlesex in last year's County Championship .","The thousands of disciples of Wisden always look immediately at who the editor has chosen as his five cricketers of the year, one of the oldest and most highly regarded prizes in sport.","Wisden chose to bestow its annual honour to the world's top players, despite athletic gifted it facessome controversy, but, to me, these cricket fans it makes our summer.",0.8490382433,0.8549362421,0.8519770503,0.064516129,0.0,0.064516129,0.064516129

The 24-year-old's treble accounted for the 46th, 47th and 48th goals scored by players from Belgium this season, making them the third most prolific nation in the division. Benteke's goals - which arrived in a memorable 3-3 draw at Villa Park - moved Belgium above France (46 goals) and within 19 of second-placed Spain (67 goals).

The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. Mabbutt's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was 'touch and go' on whether it would have to be amputated. ______ Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal it . The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think ""It's never going to happen to me"". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.' In 1982, father-of-two Mabbutt became the first diabetic ever to play for England and captained Tottenham to FA cup glory in 1991. Former star: Mabbutt is pictured, left, lifting the FA Cup while playing for Tottenham in  1991 .

205915,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,4290,1,5,"It took Louis van Gaal less than a minute of his weekly press conference to burst Manchester United's bubble and re-open some of the more troubling issues of his time in charge at Old Trafford. The Dutchman wasted no time in revealing that Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo will miss the much-anticipated clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge through injury. Four players capable of filling two key positions. 'The worst scenario,' Van Gaal called it. Wayne Rooney arrives in London ahead of the Chelsea clash while Ashley Young (right) poses with a fan . Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney could be dropped further back into midfield against Chelsea . Rooney had been impressing for the Red Devils in his favoured striking role but United have players out . Michael Carrick (left) limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo (right) picked up an injury too . Daley Blind (left) and Phil Jones (right) are also out injured for United ahead of their game with Chelsea . United midfielder Juan Mata posts a picture on his official Instagram of the squad's journey to London . United boss Louis van Gaal (left) and assistant Ryan Giggs (right) carry their luggage on Friday . Van Gaal puts his arm around Rooney during a training session earlier this week ahead of Saturday's game . The uplifting victory in last weekend's Manchester derby has come at a price. All of a sudden, United's chances of extending an impressive run of six straight Premier League wins by becoming the first top-flight team to win away at Chelsea this season look decidedly slimmer. Van Gaal must take on his old apprentice Jose Mourinho without either of his two first-choice holding midfielders, Carrick and Blind, and two senior centre-backs in Jones and Rojo. Blind was hurt in the Manchester derby by a challenge from City skipper Vincent Kompany. It means that captain Wayne Rooney is likely to be asked to sacrifice himself for the team once again by dropping into midfield — an issue that both player and manager must have hoped was behind them. With Robin van Persie not ready to return from injury, that in turn raises the old question about whether Radamel Falcao has the necessary match sharpness to replace Rooney and lead United's attack having not started a game since February. United striker Robin van Persie has not yet been passed fit enough to return to first-team action . There remain doubts over Radamel Falcao's ability to fill the void in United's attack against Chelsea . Luke Shaw is set to take over from Blind at left back despite fitness concerns that have plagued him since his £28million move from Southampton last summer and led to him being hooked at half-time in the FA Cup defeat by Arsenal last month, not to be seen since. And then there's the likely choice of replacement for Rojo between Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair, two young defenders who have not featured since January and February respectively. Both figured more prominently in the first half of the season when persistent injury problems and experimental formations slowed Van Gaal's progress. We were back on familiar ground on Friday, the fragility of United's squad all too apparent. Was he concerned by the lack of playing time among the players he may turn to? The United boss answered with one of his Dutch sayings. 'Yes, but that's also a truth like a cow,' he said. 'It means a rhetorical question. You know the answer already. 'There is more balance in the team because I have played the same line-up more. Luke Shaw (left) looks set to return to the United first-team, while Rooney will drop into midfield . 'I didn't have injuries anymore and now, coincidentally, we have four in two positions where we don't have any other players. That's difficult. 'It's the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Jonny Evans is suspended so we don't have many choices. 'Luke Shaw has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don't like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough. 'Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don't have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. ______ 'It's more when and if, and I don't believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. 'But, all right, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea's shoulders. You never know, you've seen it in previous Premier League seasons. 'They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw.' United midfielder Mata (right) gets ready to play a pass during a club training session on Friday . Van Gaal, meanwhile, will be satisfied if United hold on to third place and fulfil his primary aim of qualification for the Champions League. But he made it clear that first place is ultimately all that matters and what drives him on at the age of 63 when financial security is no longer an issue. 'We live for these titles,' he said. 'We are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. 'When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed and you have your name on it. That's why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. 'To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is why I'm still a manager because I don't have to work any more — you can count on that.'","I have to puzzle a lot.' With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over United, Van Gaal is experienced enough to know that even victory is unlikely to make any difference in the title race.

Alex Hales and Chris Woakes, two foot soldiers in the recent World Cup fiasco, both called for some rethinking of the domestic structure to avoid a repeat of what happened in Australia and New Zealand. At the launch of next month's opening of the Natwest T20 Blast Nottinghamshire's Hales admitted: 'As a team we're not hiding behind the fact that we're embarrassed about what happened. With the quality of the squad that we had there's no excuse not to make it out of the group stages.' Alex Hales believes England's players aren't competing in enough Twenty20 competitions . Hales was at Edgbaston on Thursday at the launch of this season's T20 domestic competition . Both he and Woakes feel that a way of improving England's one day cricket would be to adopt more the model of countries like Australia and India with their franchise systems. 'The Big Bash is fantastic, I've played in it for three years and really enjoyed it,' said Hales. 'I'm a big fan of the block system for T20, you dedicate three weeks to a month to hone your skills, all your focus if on T20. In the last couple of years in England I haven't had much of a chance to develop. 'Over here you play something different Sunday to Wednesday, then T20 on Friday so you don't get a huge chance to practice your skills. Over there they have less teams so the standard is fantastic. 'I think that's maybe where we got found out a bit in the World Cup, not many guys get exposed to T20. There's such a heavy schedule of Test matches guys don't get a chance to play domestic T20. Look at guys like Broady and Jimmy (Anderson), they don't get a chance to play for their counties. 'It doesn't help that a lot of our guys don't play in the IPL or the Big Bash. Other players are constantly playing in front of big crowds and improving their skills and that's not something we had in the World Cup. England were thoroughly embarrassed at the 50-over World Cup earlier this year, dumped out of their group . Brendon McCullum is adept at playing T20 all over the world and Hales wants more of that for English stars . 'It's tougher here with the indifferent weather and I don't really know what goes on behind the scenes, but in terms of standard and quality I think the franchise system would work in England.' At Thursday's Edgbaston launch there were players from all 18 counties, but that number would be cut down if the ECB and its new management ever get round to introducing a more city-based league. Woakes, who hopes to start bowling again in the next two weeks after recent foot problems, will play alongside McCullum for a Warwickshire team now styled as the Birmingham Bears. ______ It would improve the standard of cricket, it might not feel right but eventually it would. 'It's a tricky one, you would have to get counties to merge. Some players might benefit and others wouldn't. Some people are going to be unhappy. I don't think counties would be shut down but if franchises are going to happen something has to give.' Advanced ticket sales are said to be up 41 per cent on last year ahead of the May 15 start with other overseas stars in action including Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Finch, Chris Gayle and Kumar Sangakarra.","He believes the rebranding added to the support they received last season, and could so elsewhere if replicated: 'As a player you felt like there were more people behind you,' he said. 'It might attract more people to come to the ground from different areas of the city, they might feel more part of it. 'I'm sure if it happened it wouldn't feel right at first but I bet the Big Bash didn't feel right at first, everything moves forward and evolves. I think it would probably be a good thing.","The franchise system, adopted by countries like Australia and India, allows for a more comprehensive, longer-term plan that allows players to develop their skills and compete in multiple forms of T20 cricket.

Experienced players like Brendon McCullum, said England should be competing in more franchise systems, providing a consistent selection and structure for the players that can't focus solely on individual performance in major tournaments.

The league system in England, such as the NatWest T20 Blast in the North West, provides a series of matches where players can hone their skills and practices without the hectic schedules of Test matches which can expose players from other countries to the demands of major competitions.",0.8289511204,0.8391569853,0.83402282,0.2009569378,0.0096618357,0.1052631579,0.1435406699

The Miami-Dade Police Department set up a hidden camera to deal with the ongoing problem of luggage theft, and found workers rifling through checked bags both before they were loaded onto planes and once inside the aircraft's belly.

Police also caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport (above) stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera . A baggage handler (above) at JFK Airport in New York was also caught on camera going through a passenger's wallet . CNN reports that 31 employees have been arrested for theft in Miami since 2012, including six this year. Incidents of theft at that airport are far less however that New York's John F. Kennedy, which has more claims of lost property that anywhere else in the country. In 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera at that airport, and found workers stealing cash, jewelry, iPhones and iPads, which led to six arrests. Across the country in Los Angeles, 16 airport workers were fired last year after police obtained search warrants for their homes following a increase in reported thefts at the terminal where they were employed. 'We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,' said Patrick Gannon, the police chief at that airport. ______ Airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 (above a JFK employee) Most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal, with only Orlando and Miami screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only Miami screening them when they leave. Since 2002, the TSA has fired 513 workers for theft, though it is now known how many of them faced criminal charges. Gannon believes that theft is not the only problem either, as it could lead to bigger threats in the nation's airports. 'I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism.'","Overall, there have been 30,621 claims of missing valuables since 2010, with most of these coming from checked luggage.

Kerry Hamilton was finally diagnosed with leiomyosarcoma, a rare cancer of the soft tissue normally found in women over 50. At just 34, she was forced to undergo a hysterectomy and was devastated at the thought of not being able to have children. She now wants to raise awareness about rare cancers like leiomyosarcoma, so that other women with seemingly 'everyday' symptoms like cramps visit their GP. Kerry Hamilton, 34, had stomach cramps, bleeding and irregular periods for two years. Doctors finally discovered she had a tumour the size of a golf ball growing in her cervix . Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month (pictured) Since her time in South Africa (pictured) she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps . Ms Hamilton, from Birmingham, said: 'I'm on a bid to raise awareness about rare cancers and the symptoms that people might ignore - without realising that it is important to listen to their body. 'The kind of cancer I had - despite it being in my cervix - would not have showed up on a smear test. 'So it's important to visit your GP if you're concerned about anything, as well as always going for routine tests.' Ms Hamilton, an education consultant, began experiencing odd symptoms in 2009, when she flew to South Africa to volunteer at a lion research centre for a month. A week before she was due to fly home she fell violently ill with stomach cramps. She spent seven days in hospital where a local doctor told her that she was suffering with a cyst on her ovaries that had burst. Leiomyosarcomas are cancers that develop in a type of muscle tissue called smooth muscle. These muscles are found in the walls of muscular organs like the heart and the stomach. They are rare and usually only affect people over the age of 50, but they can start anywhere in the body. They most commonly start in the walls of the womb, the limbs and the digestive system. People with early leiomyosarcoma often have no symptoms. Possible . symptoms to develop as the cancer advances include a lump or swelling, . abdominal bloating, swelling or pain and a change in menstruation. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support . Over the next two years she returned to the park to work as a guide and a ranger and later returned to the UK where she started working as an educational consultant. When she returned, she went for a routine smear test in 2011 and was given the all clear. Ever since being hospitalised in South Africa she had experienced spotting in between her periods, longer periods than normal and stomach cramps. By last summer these symptoms had become worse and intense pain and lots of bleeding. Her GP suggested it was a hormonal problem and that she go on the contraceptive pill to try and control it. But as she was single, Ms Hamilton didn't see the point of using a contraceptive and felt uneasy about taking hormonal treatment. She also didn't want to ignore the signals her body was giving her, and so never took the contraceptives that were prescribed. It was only in January this year, when she was called for her next smear test, that she was finally diagnosed. The nurse due to carry out the smear said her cervix was so irritated that it was impossible to conduct the test. Ms Hamilton, pictured in 2009, became aware something was seriously wrong when a nurse couldn't perform a smear test on her as there was so much inflammation . Doctors diagnosed Ms Hamilton with a leiomyosarcoma  - a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body . She then broke the devastating news that she suspected Ms Hamilton had cancer. After an MRI scan, doctors confirmed she had leiomyosarcoma and would need a hysterectomy to save her life. A leiomyosarcoma is a cancer of the soft tissue, the muscle, fat, blood vessels, or any of the other tissues that support, surround and protect the organs of the body. Ms Hamilton's was found in the walls of her cervix. Only about 3,300 new cases of soft tissue cancers are diagnosed each year in the UK, and they mainly affect people over the age of 50. Ms Hamilton described the shock of being told she may never be able to become pregnant naturally. ______ Ms Hamilton underwent a hysterectomy at just 34-and was devastated at the thought of not being able to carry a child. But she remained positive, saying 'there is somebody else going through much worse' She underwent egg collection so that one day she might have a child that is biologically hers. On March 19th this year she underwent the operation to remove her womb – and the tumour – and is now recovering at home. While many women would become disheartened after such an ordeal, Ms Hamilton said she believes . She said: 'Luckily I am a naturally positive person, and I just think that there is somebody else going through something much worse than me. 'When I was finally diagnosed it was more of a relief than anything to know what was wrong. 'It was when I was told that I would need a hysterectomy that when it hit me, and I became really upset.' Even before she had cancer, Ms Hamilton ran the Race for Life for Cancer Research UK, and this year raising money for the charity will be more meaningful than ever. She said: 'I have done the race the last two years, and I always said I would do it every year, so this year I'm on a mission. 'I've already raised £1,600 which is so amazing and humbling.'

'But now I wouldn't be able to carry a child. 'I couldn't believe that I had cancer in my cervix for all that time.',"The article unfortunately cuts off, leaving some information about the cancer and its symptoms aside. Let's assume that it informs us about the symptoms that Kerry Hamilton experienced for two years prior to her diagnosis.

It seems likely that the untreated leiomyosarcoma affected Ms. Hamilton's irregular periods, and the experts at Macmillan Cancer Support mention that these symptoms could have been indicative of early cancer.

Given the background we've gathered, it was possible that Kerry Hamilton experienced menorrhagia (excessive bleeding during menstruation), pelvic pain and irregular periods (possibly leading to spotting as her cervix began to swell).",0.8149498701,0.8371216655,0.8258870244,0.1733333333,0.0,0.0933333333,0.12

The England international's younger sibling plays for Crawley as a winger or striker and started their game against the Latics in League One. Crawley are scrambling to avoid relegation from League One but Young was a good omen for the club as they were 2-0 up at half-time. Ashley Young went to watch his younger brother Lewis in action for Crawley against Oldham . ______ He has been an important player as Louis van Gaal's squad pushes to earn a Champions League return.

12085,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,252,3,4,"Jonathan Trott prepared for his first Test appearance since leaving the Ashes tour in turmoil 18 months ago with back-to-back failures in St Kitts. Trott, who looks sure to open with Alastair Cook in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday, fell for just two, top-edging an attempted pull against a St Kitts side bolstered by England bowlers Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood. It follows his third-ball duck at the hands of his England team-mate Jimmy Anderson but Trott at least made 72 on the first of what became four practice days instead of proper matches in St Kitts ahead of the main business next week. Jonathan Trott failed twice with the bat during England's warm-up for the first Test in Basseterre . Trott is dismissed by his England team-mate James Anderson in St Kitts . Trott’s only rival for the opener slot, Yorkshire’s Adam Lyth, was dropped twice before falling to a poor shot outside off-stump for 23 but Alastair Cook and Ian Bell looked in much more fluent form before retiring in this practice match. England gave what appeared to be a sneak preview of their side for the first Test as their low-key warm-up week meandered to a close. Their four days of cricket  have been desperately short of competitive edge and they at least ensured each of their likely team saw some batting action. Trott looks set to open the batting with Alastair Cook in Antigua in the first Test next week . England completed four days of low-key, uncompetitive warm-up action in Basseterre on Thursday . Alastair Cook . Jonathan Trott . Gary Ballance . Ian Bell . Joe Root . Ben Stokes . Jos Buttler . ______ Jimmy Anderson . The decision to linger in the middle after two rain delays in order to allow Chris Jordan and James Tredwell to face some admittedly low-quality bowling, suggested those two would claim the disputed places in the team. Barring a raging turner in Antigua next week there will be only one spinning place and Tredwell, already a likelier pick than Yorkshire's Adil Rashid, was sent in ahead of his counterpart for a late hit. His dismissal gave Rashid a chance of his own but Tredwell was given priority and can now start preparing for a second Test cap. Jordan, meanwhile, was afforded a decent stint at the crease in the final session, when England pressed for an extra half-hour's play following rain delays. That suggests he has done enough to remain ahead of Mark Wood and Liam Plunkett, who both bowled for the hosts without doing anything compelling to push their case. Captain Cook made 22 runs in the morning session before retiring on Thursday . Ian Bell looked in fluent touch as he was unbeaten on 43 when he retired . England will leave St Kitts and head to Antigua for the first Test against the West Indies on Monday . Those decisions aside the second in a pair of two-day fixtures has been little more than a glorified training drill, with Plunkett, Mark Wood and Jonny Bairstow dropped in to strengthen the flimsy local side, while Gary Ballance, Trott and Root featured for both teams at various points. Bell looked in best form, making a fluent 43 before retiring, while captain Cook also opted to end his own innings having ground out 22 runs in the morning session.",Chris Jordan . Stuart Broad .

The Argentine has scored six goals in derby meetings with United and is planning on adding to that tally when the two sides meet at Old Trafford on Sunday. 'I always love to score, but of course it is even more special to score in the big games,' he said. Sergio Aguero smashes the ball against the post during Manchester City's defeat by Crystal Palace . Aguero says scoring against Manchester United is enough to give him shivers . The Argentine forward has scored six times against United, including this one at the Etihad in September 2013 . ______ The one who in his career has been the most predatory is Falcao. 'He isn't having an easy time this season, but I really admire his commitment and his class and qualities are permanent. Aguero believes United striker Radamel Falcao (right) is one of the most gifted players in world football . Aguero came face-to-face with Falcao at Puma event on Thursday . 'He is probably one of the most naturally gifted strikers in football at the moment.' Meanwhile, Aguero is refusing to give up hope of retaining the Premier League crown this season despite slipping to fourth, nine points behind leaders Chelsea. 'Of course we can still win the title,' he insisted. 'In football, anything can happen - as soon as you think something is certain, then everything changes, we have seen it so many times before and we'll see it again. 'We only focus on ourselves, try to win every game we play and keep pressure on Chelsea.' Aguero was speaking at the #HeadtoHead event for Puma's 'evoSPEED 1.3' where he appeared alongside United's Radamel Falcao.","'If you score against United at Old Trafford it almost give you shivers, because you can feel the tense atmosphere with most of the stadium being really quiet, but the away end going crazy.

The German World Cup winner is currently on loan at Inter Milan having joined the Serie A club in January following a tough start to the season at the Emirates, where he scored just three goals in 13 appearances. The move to Italy appeared to signal the end of Podolski’s time in north London, but the 29-year-old is adamant he still has a role to play in Arsene Wenger’s side. Inter Milan loanee Lukas Podolski says he wants to play for parent club Arsenal next season . The German forward has yet to score since arriving in Serie A in January . ‘When I go back (to Arsenal) I think I have the chance to play there,’ he told Sportsmail. ‘I have one year left so well will see what happens. I feel very well at the club and with my teammates as well. I had a great two and a half years; I scored a lot of goals there and had a lot of assists. ‘The first six months of the season were not easy, that’s why I changed clubs. But now I’m ready.’ Arsenal made it to back-to-back FA Cup finals over the weekend thanks to an extra-time win over Reading and Podolski tweeted his congratulations to his parent club, although he admitted he hadn’t seen the action. The forward was busy preparing for the derby with Inter against rivals Milan, but he was left on the bench by Roberto Mancini for the second game running as the sides played out a 0-0 stalemate. Podolski struggled for first-team opportunities in north London before leaving the Gunners on loan . Podolski has failed to score in 12 appearances since arriving in Italy, but he says there is no frustration over the lack of time he’s getting on the pitch. ______ ‘Of course I want to play every game but it’s the decision of the coach, he makes the decision and picks the first XI and when he thinks the players on the pitch are better than me or in better form than me then they have to play. ‘I’m ready, I’m fit, I want to play because a derby is always a great game and it’s for these types of matches you play football. ‘I’m here now to finish the season then I have two games with the national team, then we will see.’ Podolski celebrates with Alexis Sanchez after scoring the winner against Anderlecht in October .","‘It’s not a problem for me.

3729,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l0,78,0,4,"It's T20 season on the sub-continent and the world's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the Indian Premier League, cricket's most exciting and richest domestic tournament. Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title . CHENNAI SUPER KINGS . The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final . £1,740,000 - Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. 3325 - runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119 - wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60 - matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8 - teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 -  English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS . The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team . KINGS XI PUNJAB . After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. ______ KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS . The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League . MUMBAI INDIANS . The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood. After losing in the eliminator against Chennai last year, the Mumbai Indians will once again expect to reach the play-offs and mount a serious challenge for the title. ONE TO WATCH: The demon bowler that is MALINGA has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the IPL and was key in their success in 2013. He will once again lead this bowling attack. Mumbai Indians batsman Rohit Sharma pictured in action for India against Bangladesh at the World Cup . 2008: Rajasthan Royals . 2009: Deccan Chargers (defunct) 2010: Chennai Super Kings . 2011: Chennai Super Kings . 2012: Kolkata Knight Riders . 2013: Mumbai Indians . 2014: Kolkata Knight Riders . RAJASTHAN ROYALS . Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan . Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals . ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE . Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (£1.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack. ONE TO WATCH: Any of their big three batsmen really, but DE VILLIERS is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots. Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle pictured playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2012 tournament . South African AB de Villiers is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket . SUNRISERS HYDERABAD . The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL . Kevin Pietersen, here playing for Delhi in 2012, will join Hyderabad if they make the play-offs .",One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title .,"I can provide you with a few missing articles:

But the Tiger Woods who has turned up to Augusta National this year is different. Very different. Earlier this week we were treated to the sight of Woods embracing Darren Clarke on the practice ground. Europe's Ryder Cup captain is an old pal of Tiger's so that was unusual, but understandable. So too was the sight of him sharing a hearty laugh with his old mucker, Mark O'Meara. But dancing? Yes, Tiger Woods dancing. Forget unusual, that is almost alarming. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO OF TIGER WOODS DANCING WHILE PRACTISING . Tiger Woods was spotted dancing while he practised on Monday at Augusta National . The former world No 1 had headphones in both ears as he listened to music while honing his game . A video has emerged of the former world No 1, with headphones in each ear, bopping away while he honed his wedge game on the practice ground on Monday. No prizes for the first person to ask: 'was he listening to Tiger Feet?' Augusta's patrons were treated to another glimpse of the new, cuddly Tiger on Wednesday morning as he enjoyed another manly hug with veteran Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez. Woods shared a warm greeting with Miguel Angel Jimenez on Wednesday morning . The 14-time major champion embraced the veteran Spaniard on the practice ground at Augusta . Jimenez watches on as Woods hits a drive during the build-up to the Masters . Perhaps the 50-year-old was offering Woods some tips on how to play the course, having finished fourth last year. Woods may be a four-time Masters champion but he has not played competitively since the first week in February and has battled through a bout of the chipping yips. Maybe the tunes have helped to release some of the tension in his short game. Woods will also play in the traditional Masters warm-up, the Par-3 Contest, for the first time in 11 years on Wednesday. ______ Woods is watched by his coach, Chris Como, as he hits on the driving range on Wednesday . Meanwhile, Australia's Marc Leishman has withdrawn from the Masters due to personal reasons. Leishman's wife Audrey was taken ill with an apparent case of pneumonia last week and put into an induced coma in hospital. 'It is with both deep regret and incredible relief I am withdrawing from the Masters tournament this week,' Leishman said in a statement. 'My wife Audrey has survived a life threatening medical emergency and I have decided to remain by her side with our children. 'Thanks to an incredible team of doctors and nurses Audrey appears to be on the road to a full recovery. Our two young children remain blessed to have the world's best mum in their lives. I want to pass along our thanks to all who supported us through this difficult period. 'We ask that you keep Audrey in your thoughts and prayers and I wish my best to all of the competitors for a great 2015 Masters.' Leishman finished joint fourth at Augusta when fellow Australian Adam Scott won the Masters in 2013. He had been due to tee off at 4:03pm BST on Thursday alongside former champion Ian Woosnam and Erik Compton. His withdrawal brings the field down to 97 players.","The 39-year-old will be joined by his daughter, Sam, 7, and his son, Charlie, 6, for the event, which is a light-hearted affair for the players and their families. Woods and former champion Ben Crenshaw compare putters on the 13th green during a practice round .","Based on the article, I attempted to fill in the two blank spaces with two common words that fit the context.

(I chose ""retrieve"" because Tiger Woods is known for his intense preparation for major tournaments, including the Masters, and might be trying to recover from a bout of the chipping yips.)

Missing 2: his support system.

According to the Madrid-based publication, Los Blancos have won 80 per cent of their games when Rodriguez is in the side compared to just 58 per cent when he's been missing.

The two giants from the Spanish capital played out a goalless draw, meaning all is left to play for in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu. Here, Sportsmail rates the players in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final at the Vicente Calderon. ATLETICO MADRID . Jan Oblak 9 - Blocked everything in the first half as a wind-assisted Real Madrid looked like putting the tie beyond doubt in the first 45 minutes. Had less to do in the second half but did it well. A man of the match display from the 22-year-old. Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak made a big save to deny Gareth Bale in the early minutes . Juanfran 7 - He was rattled, along with the rest of the team, in the first half but he played his part in keeping Madrid at bay. Miranda 7 - Will not have put any watching suitors off with another solid display alongside Godin - that is the third time this season Real have failed to score against Atletico Madrid at the Calderon and Miranda is a major reason for that. Diego Godin 7 - A rare slip early on let Bale in but the Welshman failed to punish the Uruguayan and he recovered well to marshall the team to another clean sheet against the European champions. At times in the first half he must have been seeing flashbacks of extra time in Lisbon but came through without conceding. Atletico Madrid centre-back Diego Godin rises higher than Sergio Ramos to attempt a header on goal . Guilherme Siqueira 6 - No mystery why Diego Simeone wants Felipe Luis back at the club next season. Siquiera is a threat going forward but a liability defensively and will be replaced in the summer. Arda Turan 7 - Always bright going forward and tested Casillas in the second period with a shot the Spain keeper did well to save. Will be vital in nicking a goal at the Bernabeu next week. Mario Suarez 6 - Forced a fine second-half save from Casillas but was just as blown away by Real in the first 45 minutes. Will still be a steal for someone at the end of the season if, as expected, he moves on. Gabi 6 - Simeone's soldier worked hard in defence in the first period but maybe lacked invention in the second period as Atletico took the initiative. Cristiano Ronaldo is crowded out by Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez (left) and Gabi . Koke 6 - Currently struggling to live up to those 'new Xavi' tags. Still a tremendous prospect and gave as good as he got against Real's trio of Modric, James and Kroos. Antoine Griezmann 7 - You can see why he has scored 21 goals this season in a little over 40 games. He is always bright and showed pace and surprising strength in the first period to pull away from Ramos. Tough to play against and he will be important for Atletico on the break at the Bernabeu. Mario Mandzukic 7 - The old warhorse was elbowed by Ramos, bitten and punched by Carvajal and booked for complaining. He was a bloody hero too and had to be bandaged up midway through the second half. Still lacks that pace to pull away into space that Diego Costa has. Substitutes: Raul Garcia (Griezmann 77), Torres (Koke 83). Not used: Moya, Tiago, Saul, Jesus Gamez, Gimenez. REAL MADRID . Iker Casillas 7- Stayed awake in the first half as Real poured forward but Atletico Madrid still threatened on the break. Also kept out Mario Suarez' late shot as Real managed to hang on. Iker Casillas makes a save as Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres goes for the ball . Dani Carvajal 7 - Was used as an auxiliary winger in the first 45 minutes as Real tried to take advantage of Siqueira’s weakness. Also scrapped at the back and landed a punch and a bite on Manzukic as tempers frayed. That might still cost him his place in the second leg. ______ His first half sprint down the right was worthy of Bale. Is there a quicker defender in Europe at the moment? Quite possibly not. When Pepe pulled out before the start of the game many Real Madrid fans would have feared the worst but Varane never put a foot wrong. Raphael Varane was in excellent form for Real Madrid in defence at the Vicente Calderon . Sergio Ramos 6 - Left trailing in Griezmann’s wake early on but was a match for Mandzukic. Solid but without the heroics of Lisbon and that last-minute goal. Marcelo 7 - Asked to attack less in the first half with Carvajal trying to do more damage on the other flank. Did all that was asked of him defensively without shining going forward as he can do. Booked and will not play second leg. Luka Modric 7 - Majestic in the first half as Madrid dominated but faded like his team in the second. Still the most complete midfielder that Real Madrid have and they were never going to lose 4-0 as they did in February without him. He will be vital in the second leg. Luka Modric was majestic in the first half for Real Madrid, but he faded along with the team in the second . Toni Kroos 6 - A shame that he has less license to attack in his current incarnation as Madrid’s holder. Covered ground, got Madrid passing and still managed a shot that Oblak saved, but wouldn't he have more influence on games if he played slightly further forward? James Rodriguez 6 - Only just back from injury and it showed in the second half. Could easily have made way for Isco, who eventually replaced Benzema. Has magic in his boots and had a fine chance to win it on the night but couldn't take it. Gareth Bale 7 - Provided cross after cross in the first half as he tormented Siqueira but they came to nothing and Madrid were left to rue the chance he had when Godin slipped and he was through on Oblak’s goal. He will be blamed because of that miss but worked hard and could still be key in the second leg with Atletico's weakness at left back. Bale missed an excellent opportunity to give Real the lead and a priceless away goal . Karim Benzema 5 - Struggles to score against Atletico and was taken off in the second half as he once again failed to puncture their rearguard. Missed a fine chance in the second period when for some reason he flicked the ball back towards Ronaldo instead of trying to beat Oblak himself. Cristiano Ronaldo 6 - Had several free-kicks in the first half that failed to trouble Oblak, Also failed to connect with those excellent first-half crosses from Bale. Atletico Madrid are a tough nut to crack and the world’s most expensive forward line couldn’t find the vital away goal. Ronaldo was just as responsible as Bale and Benzema for that. Substitutes: Arbeloa (Carvajal 85), Isco (Benzema 76). Not used: Navas, Pepe, Khedira, Jese, Illarramendi. Ronaldo endured a frustrating evening as he was unable to find a breakthrough for his team .",Raphael Varane 8 - Real Madrid's best performer.

The Magpies are in danger of being sucked into what had previously seemed an unlikely relegation battle given their alarming run of form. Amid accusations of the team 'playing with their flip-flops on', United have lost four on the spin - scoring just once - and Carver admits he does not know where their next point is coming from. It is unlikely to arrive at Anfield, a venue at which they last won in 1994. They were beaten 1-0 by North-East rivals Sunderland seven days ago – a performance Carver labelled 'embarrassing' – and there was a showdown meeting at the club's training ground this week in which the head coach let his feelings be known. John Carver says his Newcastle players have a point to prove when they face Liverpool on Monday . Carver, though, is hoping that personal pride will kick in when they travel to Merseyside. 'Before they go out my message will be simple – 'You have a point to prove, but prove it for yourself, not for me, not for anybody else, but for yourself. You owe it for yourself',' he said. 'The meeting we had on Wednesday was non-negotiable. We've had meetings in the past where I like a two-way dialogue. 'But I got a few things off my chest and it was probably the first time I've been Mr Nasty. 'After the meeting we trained and there was a great response. That hurt me a little bit because I wanted to see that on Sunday. But at least I got something from them.' Carver said this week that owner Mike Ashley has promised to invest in the squad this summer and a major overhaul is expected – out-of-contract players such as Jonas Gutierrez, Ryan Taylor and Sammy Ameobi will be released, while the likes of Yoan Gouffran, Cheick Tiote, Moussa Sissoko and Papiss Cisse are also expected to move on. Newcastle in training earlier this week for their game against Liverpool on Monday in the Premier League . Moussa Sissoko (left), Vurnon Anita (centre) and Massadio Haidara (right) at a training session . However, the promise of such renovation has done little to appease fans who are organising a boycott ahead of next Sunday's visit of Spurs. Carver, in fairness, is caught in the middle of what is a toxic relationship between supporters and the club's hierarchy. And the 50-year-old admits he has been on the receiving end of criticism from fans. 'I have to accept what people say. As long as it is done the right way and in a constructive manner, I can accept that,' he said. ______ What I won't take is abuse, and certainly none of my family will take abuse. 'But I wanted to give this a go because I didn't want to have any regrets. I believe in my own ability and I believe if I have got the tools then I could do a good job and a successful job.'","Newcastle were beaten in last weekend's Tyne/Wear derby by Jermain Defoe's stunning volley . Carver has now seen his Newcastle team lose four in a row and fall into relegation danger . 'It would be easy to say, 'I've had enough, thanks'. I'm not going to do that and I have still got my enthusiasm. 'I can't hide from what happened on Sunday, and I won't hide from it.","Carver admitted that his ownership has promised to invest in the squad this summer and although the expected players to move out include major overhaul players such as Jonas Gutierrez and Ryan Taylor, does not seem to be living up to the end of their promise. Carver had recently demonstrated personal pride and private fulfillment during a training session with his victims during the congested practice period.

On loan at Charlton, the 23-year-old feared he may not play for the Gunners again. 'Well, obviously that was in my head and I think at the time my loan had finished the first month. I could see the injuries over there, I think Arteta was out, Ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and I extended it and thought maybe I won’t get the chance now,' added Coquelin. The midfielder is determined to prove himself at Arsenal and hold down his place in the starting XI. The 23-year-old is not shy of putting in a robust challenge on opponents as he adds steel to Arsenal's midfield . 'I always had confidence in myself and belief in myself I just need the chance. I got the chance because other people got injured and tried to grab it with both hands and do as well as I could,' he told BT Sport. Arsenal have been much maligned in recent seasons for lacking grit and strength in the centre of the park, but Coquelin is happy to focus on the defensive side of the game. 'The way I think is that I’m just trying to do what’s best for the team. There are other players who can do this job and I’m trying to focus on mine which is to get the ball back and help the team defensively,' added the 23-year-old. Coquelin, tackling Manchester City's David Silva, has managed to establish a starting place in the Arsenal XI . 'Obviously sometimes you want to get involved a little bit more because we play great football and this is Arsenal, you always want to get involved moving forward. But you need to think about the defensive aspect and that is what my job is all about.' Arsene Wenger's side have been in top form in the Premier League, winning their last six matches to close the gap on Manchester City in second and establish a place in the prestigious top four. The Gunners take on Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday in a pivotal clash in the race for Champions League football, but Arsenal's 'new Vieira' is confident. ______ Guests include Ian Wright, Harry Redknapp, Piers Morgan and Michael Owen.","'We obviously want to win this game you know, it’s a massive one, really important and we can increase the gap to nine points if we win so yes, I think it’s really important,' said the Frenchman. 'I can’t say definitely because mathematically it won’t be over, so I can’t say that, but yes we see a lot of confidence in us because over the last few months we have had some big results and if we can beat Liverpool it will be another massive one.' Coquelin celebrates with countryman Olivier Giroud as Arsenal managed to win every game in March .

For the first time since November 23, 2013 United sit above 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City in the Premier League after having played the same number of games. Following City's 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Monday night they now trail Louis van Gaal's side by a point ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford.

Wayne Rooney (centre) scored a stunning half-volley as  United beat Aston Villa 3-1 on Saturday . City now trail United by a point, following Monday's defeat at Palace, with seven league games remaining . The last time this had happened United sat sixth on 20 points, one ahead of then ninth-placed City after 11 games during the 2013-14 campaign. This had occurred following City's 1-0 defeat at Sunderland on November 10, 2013 while a Robin van Persie header gave the Red Devils victory over Arsenal by the same scoreline going into the international break. ______ Yet post-Ferguson United had only managed to sit above City in the league twice after the same amount of games prior to Monday. Aside from November 23, 2013 the on other occasion occurred on August 26, 2013. Back then this was after the second game of last season as City's 3-2 defeat at Cardiff allowed United to move a point ahead of them following their 0-0 draw against Chelsea. With the Red Devils looking down on their bitter rivals once more, they'll look to extend their one point gap to four  with victory in the derby on Sunday. United have only sat above City twice  - in the post Sir Alex Ferguson era - having played the same games . The first time came in August 2013 when City lost 3-2 at Cardiff thanks to Frazier Campbell's (left) winner . United then moved a point clear of City the next day following a 0-0 draw at home to Chelsea .","However, the intervening 499-day period had been one dominated by Manuel Pellegrini's side as they won the league title and the Capital One Cup last season. In comparison, United slumped to seventh in the table - their lowest-ever finish in the Premier League era - with former manager David Moyes sacked as a consequence for their woeful results. United were last above City in the league after an equal amount of games  on November 23, 2013 . This occurred after City's defeat at Sunderland, Robin van Persie's header gave United a 1-0 win vs Arsenal . United's fall from grace was in stark contrast to the 2012-13 term - when they won the title in Sir Alex Ferguson's last as  Old Trafford boss.","The missing sentences are:

Shadow health secretary and keen football fan Andy Burnham said the move could unlock £400 million to nurture the talents of the next generation of stars over the course of the next parliament. And he said Labour was ready to legislate if necessary to ensure elite clubs lived up to their 1999 promise to support struggling community facilities and projects. Andy Burnham (left) and Ed Miliband promise that Labour will make the Premier League invest in grassroots . Mr Burnham accused Prime Minister David Cameron of failing to get tough on the Premier League despite a massive increase in its TV revenues during his time in power. Although the league puts £168million into grassroots sport, this represents only a fraction of the £5billion it has taken in from TV deals between 2013 and 2016, said Labour. Mr Burnham said: 'The last Labour government secured a commitment from the Premier League that five per cent of all TV income should be invested in the grassroots. 'Since then, TV rights have soared by over 160 per cent, but David Cameron has failed to make sure that the game's elite honours its obligations to the next generation coming through. David Cameron is accused of not keeping his promises and getting tough on the Premier League . 'Football at grassroots is struggling and, in many cities, Premier League stadia loom over run-down changing rooms and overgrown pitches. ______ This will have a profoundly positive impact on football and many other sports.' BT Sport and Sky Sports were part of the lucrative TV deal estimated around £5billion starting in 2016 . A Premier League spokesman said: 'The success of the Premier League benefits the development of the English game outside of the top flight. Significant investment has flowed through all levels of the game from the grassroots upwards, and well in excess of the five per cent of domestic live broadcast revenues agreed in 2005. 'Only last month Premier League clubs committed to investing at least £1bn outside of the league from 2016-2019. That will mean even more investment in grass-roots football. 'Currently we invest £56m per season in this important work and Premier League football will generate over £1.2bn in tax revenue for the Treasury this year alone. 'This investment has seen over 50 new artificial pitches built in local communities and our club's coaches delivering thousands of PE lessons in primary schools across the country during the 2014/15 season.' Grassroot football is crucial to the development of young players and good facilities like this are needed .","The gap between top and bottom in our national sport has never been wider.

Leeds issued a lengthy statement outlining Hardaker's punishment, which will also see him forfeit one month's salary to be donated to a local charity and do up to 20 hours a week of voluntary work for the club's foundation for the duration of his contract.

292652,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,6097,2,5,"Come the end of this season, Malky Mackay’s tenure at Wigan Athletic might just be remembered as one of the costliest appointments in the history of English football. A second relegation in three seasons would be damaging enough for a club that enjoyed eight largely successful years in the Barclays Premier League. And after failing to secure a single win at home in six months in charge — culminating in a woeful 2-0 defeat by Derby on Monday — Mackay would certainly shoulder much of the blame for that. ______ 20.8 - Mackay's win percentage with Wigan since taking over in November . But Dave Whelan will also have to accept that his misguided decision to appoint the controversial Scot in the first place has cost him his reputation and seriously harmed the image of a fine football club too. People did try to warn Whelan when he first entertained the idea of replacing Uwe Rosler with Mackay last November. But Whelan demonstrated how little regard he had for an Football Association investigation into an exchange of racist, sexist, homophobic and anti-Semitic messages between Mackay and his former Cardiff City colleague, Iain Moody, by not only appointing him but then trying to justify the decision with some deeply offensive remarks of his own. Whelan was punished by the FA for his comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities and was left with little choice but to step down as chairman, wisely handing the reins to a grandson who can now begin the process of repairing some of that damage. It will take time, of course. Particularly when the response of too many in and around the club was to try to defend the indefensible, refusing to take any responsibility for the problems the club was enduring. It could yet prove that the ‘very difficult decision’ announced by the new chairman, David Sharpe, on Monday night has been made too late. Wigan are eight points from safety with only five games remaining, after all. This is how Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton revealed the investigation in August 2014 . Sportsmail led the way with the exclusive story about Mackay and his Cardiff City colleague Iain Moody . Mackay was appointed manager of Wigan in November 2014 but has arguably harmed the football club . Whelan's appointment of Mackay did little good for the club as they face relegation from the Championship . How the Championship table currently shapes up . But it might have become an awful lot more uncomfortable before it got better, irrespective of where Wigan finish up in the Championship. As Sportsmail revealed last month, an FA investigation first launched last August — with the publication of the Textgate scandal messages in this newspaper — was close to being concluded in February. But new evidence was presented to the FA that forced the governing body’s disciplinary chiefs to reopen the investigation, with sources suggesting it could be the summer before we have an outcome. The FA had already spent months wrestling with the issue of private and public communication, and whether they could charge an individual when the emails and text messages were exchanged between Mackay and Moody in their capacity as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff. Reports that suggested Mackay and Moody were likely to escape punishment prompted more witnesses to come forward, however, with individuals Mackay might have considered allies among those to have submitted fresh information. Despite trouble on and off the pitch, Sportsmail understands he was granted a stay of execution in February after a 1-0 away victory at Reading. Wigan were said to be content with keeping their boss until at least the end of the season and sources at the DW Stadium indicated Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so. And hours before the Scot was sacked he talked up Wigan’s chances of Championship survival, despite overseeing a 10th home defeat in 13 matches. ‘It’s still mathematically possible,’ insisted Mackay. ‘I’ve got a team which is putting performances in every week. It’s fine lines between winning and losing in this league.’ Wigan vice-Chairman Phillip Williams, John Winstanley and Brian Ashcroft look on along with chairman David Sharpe (far right) during their 2-0 defeat by Derby . New Wigan chairman Sharpe, pictured reacting to a piece of play on the pitch, saw his club lose on Monday . Hours before being sacked, Mackay talked up Wigan’s chances of Championship survival despite the defeat . Substitute Chris Martin and Darren Bent struck for Derby as they moved up to fifth in the table. In their dugout was Steve McClaren — a man overlooked for the Wigan job in June 2013 when Owen Coyle replaced the departing Roberto Martinez. Ultimately, Mackay lost his job not because of an FA investigation but because he failed to win football matches. As a brief club statement highlighted, a return of only 19 points from a possible 72 is disastrous. But at least the outcome of the FA enquiries is no longer Wigan’s concern. At least they can now turn to someone like Gary Caldwell, Alan Stubbs or Danny Wilson — the names thought to be in the frame on Monday night — without the baggage that arrived with Mackay. The harm has been done but now begins the recovery. Derby's players celebrate after Chris Martin's goal gave them the lead in the second half against Wigan .

He used to worked in Manchester's Chinatown before moving to Cheadle Hulme, near Stockport, and opening a Wing's restaurant there. He was so successful, however, that he left his wife in charge of that establishment and opened his flagship restaurant in the city centre. Wing's is the go-to place for footballers in Manchester, with Wayne Rooney a regular (pictured previously) Captain Rooney pictured previously at Wing's restaurant for a Q and A session with United supporters . But I couldn't afford it, could I? You could actually! There is an extensive a la carte menu, but there are also two set banquet options coming in at £30.90 or £44.90 per person. Banquet B at £44.90 per person offers: . Starter - Steamed scallop in shell with garlic and glass vermicelli. Second course - Baked lobster with ginger and spring onions. Main courses - Crispy chilli shredded fillet steak, steamed sea bass with ginger and spring onions in soya sauce, quick-fried sea treasures (monkfish fillet, scallops and king prawns), stir-fried king prawns and Chinese greens, as well as pak far roasted duck, all served with mixed seafood fried rice. Dessert - Fresh fruit platter. Rooney pictured leaving Wing's previously after having lunch with his manager and brother-in-law .

The fighter celebrates after winning the vacant WBO world junior welterweight title . After the fight ended, promoter Bob Arum shouted 'That's why he's the fighter of the year!' Dulorme, the 27-year-old Puerto Rican, is 22-2. He had won his last six bouts since moving down in class after being knocked out by Luis Carlos Abregu at 147 pounds in a welterweight fight in October 2012. 'It was a great opportunity for us,' Dulorme said. 'It wasn't the best night. We were winning in the cards, it's something that basically happened. ... We did the fight that we came here to do.' Crawford seemed measured in his approach the first two rounds against the quick-starting Dulorme, who entered the ring wearing a gladiator helmet and breastplate. Dulorme was clearly the aggressor early against Crawford, who went with a red Nebraska Cornhuskers cap for his entry. Crawford dominated the fight throughout and Dulmorne couldn't handle his speed and punching power . But in round 3, there was a quick exchange of punches, and later a hard body blow by Crawford. There were times in the fourth and fifth rounds when Crawford either smiled or shook his head after taking blows from Dulorme. Crawford taunted him, and at the end of the fourth had him back into a corner and delivered two big rights. Crawford was also smiling at the end of the fifth round, then came out in the sixth and ended the fight. 'Just having fun with it,' he said. 'When I'm having fun, I don't think nobody can beat me because that means I'm in my rhythm.' Crawford knocks down the Puerto Rican following a combination of punches in the sixth round . Crawford's trainer, Brian McIntyre, said the first couple of rounds were just a matter of Crawford getting his timing down. McIntyre said they knew the punching Dulorme would wear out, though he lasted longer than they expected. Arum this week called Crawford a new superstar on the horizon, and said this fight a 'very, very crucial first step' for Crawford to join the truly elite group of fighters. Arum was at the bout halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth that came only two weeks before the long-awaited fight in Las Vegas between another of his boxers, Manny Pacquiao, and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Dulmore was unable to recover from his knockdown and the referee stopped the fight . In an earlier eight-round lightweight matchup of previously unbeaten fighters, Ismail Muwendo from Minneapolis improved to 17-0 with a majority decision over Rolando Chinea from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. One judge had the fight as a draw, while the others had it in favor of Muwendo. Chinea dropped to 10-1-1. Benjamin 'The Blaxican' Whitaker from San Antonio improved to 9-1 as a pro with a unanimous decision over Skender Halili, a boxer from nearby Fort Worth whose had won each of his previous eight professional fights by knockout. Michigan's Anthony Barnes won a unanimous decision over Fort Worth's Martinez Porter in a six-round super middleweight bout.","'I knew I hurt him, I felt it,' Crawford said.",It was Terease Crawford .,0.8361650705,0.8524333835,0.8442208767,0.2857142857,0.0,0.2857142857,0.2857142857
131392,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l4,2738,0,1,"Michael Vaughan will become the most powerful man in English cricket if he is confirmed as Paul Downton’s successor at the helm of the national team. It emerged on Thursday that the former England captain has already held talks with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison and is in pole position to become the new director of cricket ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart. Yet Vaughan will demand almost unprecedented responsibility if he is to head up the revolution that Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves have begun with Wednesday’s sacking of Downton as managing director. Clearly, if the ECB are going to land the man who appears to be their first choice then they will have to make him a supremo with powers not seen since Ray Illingworth’s controversial reign in the early 1990s. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket . Vaughan was understood to be talking to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No1 choice . The exact terms of the new position were discussed at Thursday’s meeting of the ECB management board but if the director is to be Vaughan then he will command overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Vaughan is one of the busiest men in cricket, earning close to £1million a year through his various media roles with the BBC, Sky, Channel 5 and the Daily Telegraph and his involvement with sponsors and the ISM management group. If he is to give up all of that — and it would be a clear conflict of interests if he continues his involvement in an agency that represents Stuart Broad, Joe Root and Jos Buttler — then he will want a massive salary and ultimate control of the team. On the day that both Strauss and Stewart threw their hats into the ring for the new job, one source told Sportsmail that Vaughan’s appointment was already a done deal and that he could even be unveiled before Monday’s first Test in the West Indies. Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday . Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators . Ultimately the decision will be taken by Harrison and particularly Graves, who is close to Vaughan and is clearly keen to implement huge and rapid change in the national team as he did at Yorkshire. The implications of the return to the England set-up of the 2005 Ashes-winning captain would be significant for the leading figures in the domestic game. If Vaughan becomes supremo then there may not even be the need for a head coach and, if the position does remain, it is impossible to envisage Peter Moores surviving even if England win their Test series against West Indies. Vaughan has been a constant critic of the coach in his second coming, saying he would be better off working with young players. There is no doubt that Graves — and Vaughan — would love Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie to succeed Moores, but convincing the Australian to throw in his lot with England will be challenging. Gillespie is happy at Headingley and with his Big Bash role with Adelaide. Vaughan, who has been an outspoken pundit, would have to build some bridges were he to take the role. Alastair Cook has often been a target of Vaughan’s sometimes inconsistent criticisms and would be on borrowed time as England captain under him unless he scores big runs and wins lots of Test matches quickly. Vaughan was particularly critical of Jonathan Trott for his departure from last year's Ashes tour of Australia . Also, Vaughan would have to provide an explanation to Jonathan Trott for his strongly-worded column on his departure from the last Ashes tour with what was eventually diagnosed as ‘situational anxiety.’ Vaughan said he felt ‘conned’ by Trott, who he accused of ‘doing a runner’ from Australia. One man who would greet Vaughan’s succession more warmly than most would undoubtedly be Kevin Pietersen, who would be handed a clear route back into the England team by the appointment of the captain he got on best with. If Pietersen scores heavily for Surrey and Vaughan is at the helm of the England team then a comeback that appeared impossible just a few months ago after the publication of his bitter autobiography really would be on. There is no doubt that if the job description had remained the same to that of Downton’s then Strauss, who said  that he would be interested in the job, would be the outstanding candidate. Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role . Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket . Strauss is widely respected by the England team and management but would be far more comfortable in a suit with distance between him and the players rather than in a tracksuit at the heart of the dressing room. The apparent moving of the goalposts, with the business side of Downton’s role now disappearing, would seem to favour Vaughan over Strauss. The third man on the shortlist, Stewart, remains the outsider of the trio. These are clearly seismic times for English cricket with Graves and Harrison apparently dismantling everything created by ex-chairman Giles Clarke, who was  confirmed in a new role as ECB president. The bottom line is, with national selector James Whitaker in danger of becoming the next to follow Downton out of the door, the whole senior structure of the England team could change before this year’s Ashes. If the dominoes keep crashing down, Vaughan could be at the helm of an England team this summer with Gillespie as his coach, Joe Root as captain and Pietersen back in the team. And that, following 15 months of turmoil since the England team unravelled so dramatically by losing the Ashes 5-0, would be truly remarkable. ______ PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen — says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He’s only interested if there’s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator – and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes — and 26 Test wins overall, a national record. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Joe Root is a particular favourite — he is next in line to replace Alastair Cook as Test captain. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Vaughan is interested in the job in principle, and is close to incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He may decide he’s enjoying his media career too much to risk entering firing line.","Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey.

Raymond Billam illegally pocketed £15,000 of taxpayers' money after he said he was severely disabled due to back and knee problems. But fraud investigators secretly filmed the 40-year-old midfielder taking to the pitch for a Sunday League team after being tipped-off about his fraudulent claims. The grandfather-of-four admitted benefit fraud and was sentenced to 26-weeks in prison suspended for two years. Cheat: Raymond Billam, 40, claimed he was unable to walk more than a few metres, but was filmed running and jumping as he took to the pitch for his pub football team . Shaven headed Billam claimed he was unable to walk more than 20 metres without falling and needed crutches to get around. But between September 2008 and April 2014 he pulled on the green and black shirt of Ingsfield Lane football club and two other teams in the Mexborough and District Sunday League. In total Billam of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, played over 87 games while dishonestly claiming incapacity benefit, Barnsley Magistrates Court was told. Julie Grant, prosecuting, said: 'Over three consecutive Sundays he was playing football, running, jumping and participating fully showing no signs of discomfort.' His appearances and goals were even posted on the internet, magistrates' heard. 'Clearly this is not consistent with somebody unable to walk without aids,' the prosecutor added. When Billam was arrested he said he had 'good days and bad days' and he was so well-known in the league that others could have been playing under his name. But he could not provide investigators with a list of names. Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing £15,066 through dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances which affected his disability living allowance. Chris Peace, defending, said Billam, who has four grandchildren, had worked as a contractor for Yorkshire Water for 16 years until he suffered a serious back injury in 2006 which needed surgery. He initially  made a legitimate claim and went from 13 to 18 and a half stones and had problems with drinking and gambling. ______ Billam, who was taking jobs as a self employed plumber by October 2013, accepted that he should have notified the Department of Work and Pensions earlier that he was fit to work. 'The allowance was a regular source of income and he had three children at home and it was very difficult to do without that,' his lawyer said. 'It was difficult to wave goodbye to that when you have lots of bills.' The court heard Billam was repaying the money and the whole amount outstanding would be paid off. Billam was given a 26-week jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and he will be subject to an electronically monitored daily curfew for four months. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing. 'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance. 'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'","'He was in a bit of a state,' said Mr Peace. The court heard that playing football helped Billam recover from the the low point in his life. Billam had claimed more than £15,000 in incapacity benefit when the Department of Work and Pensions were tipped off . Unknown to the grandfather-of-four he was secretly filmed by fraud investigators donning his green and black shirt . Billam was sentenced to a 26-week suspended prison sentence after he admitted benefit fraud .",grabs,0.8191928267,0.7598930597,0.7884294987,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Ahead of the blockbuster clash at Stamford Bridge, the United squad were pictured travelling down to London on Friday afternoon. Led by captain Wayne Rooney the Red Devils' contingent commuted via Stockport Railway Station to the English capital.

United boss Louis van Gaal  faces a number of selection dilemmas ahead of their clash against the Blues . It was earlier revealed that the 29-year-old striker may have to revert to a midfield role against the Blues after Michael Carrick and Daley Blind were two of four  United players ruled out of the clash due to injury. However, Van Gaal is able to call upon the services of in-form midfielder Juan Mata who is returning to the home of his former club for the first time on Saturday. Mata, who won three trophies in two-and-a-half successful seasons at the Bridge, posted a picture via his Instagram account as the United players boarded the train on Friday afternoon. Accompanied with the caption: 'I got back to London a few times, but this one it's different... Big game, lots of memories, great day of football!... #CFC vs #MUFC' United's No 8 was all smiles as he gears up for what promises to be emotional return to west London. Alongside the injuries of Carrick and Blind, United duo Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were also absent from the train ride - with the quartet all suffering injuries following United's 4-2 win over bitter rivals Manchester City on April 12. The club's injury setback means that Luke Shaw and Radamel Falcao could both be recalled against Jose Mourinho’s side. And the latter was all smiles alongside Victor Valdes as they travelled down to London on Friday. Falcao is one of several selection dilemmas that Van Gaal and assistant boss Ryan Giggs have to make for the trip against Chelsea; in what the Dutchman described  as ‘the worst scenario’. Michael Carrick (left) limped off against Manchester City while Marcos Rojo picked up an injury soon after . Van Gaal also revealed in his pre-match press conference that Daley Blind (left) and Phil Jones are out .

Van Gaal (left) has revealed that Rooney may play in holding midfield role against Chelsea . 4-1-4-1: De Gea; Valencia, Smalling, Blackett, Shaw; Rooney; Mata, Herrera, Fellaini, Young; Falcao . ‘I have to tell that we have four injuries who played the last match so that’s not so good for us,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We had very good hope that we should recover two of the four but it’s not like that. Carrick is out and Rojo is out, but also Blind and Jones,' the 63-year-old said at United's pre-match press conference on Friday. ‘That’s the worst scenario because Rojo and Jones are good players at the left central defender position. Evans is suspended so we don’t have many choices. Blind and Carrick could play the midfield holding position and I don’t have any other option, or I have to play Wayne Rooney in that position again. I have to puzzle a lot for tomorrow. ‘Other players can take profit of the momentum now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team. ‘You have seen that I took Jones off pitch (against Manchester City) because of injury, you have seen that Carrick was off the pitch, you have seen the tackle of Kompany against Blind. Only Rojo is a little bit surprising because he felt it the day after the match. ‘It’s because of the distance between the matches. Blind and Jones were very close to playing but it was not enough. ‘Other players can take profit of the moment now. It’s always like that. It’s not special in the life of a manager or a team.’ Van Gaal addresses the media ahead of Man United's crucial Premier League clash with Chelsea on Saturday .

Fellaini (centre right) is embraced by his team-mates after scoring against rivals Manchester City last week . Sports analysts BSports predict that a Chelsea win is easily the most likely outcome at Stamford Bridge . Asked if Shaw could return for the first time since being substituted in the FA Cup defeat to Arsenal last month amid concerns over his fitness, Van Gaal replied: ‘Maybe you shall see tomorrow [Saturday]. You never know. Luke is fit enough I think. He has already had more than four or five weeks with no match and I don’t like that. But we train and I think he is fit enough.’ With Chelsea holding an eight-point lead and a game in hand over third-placed United, Van Gaal believes it is asking too much for his team to win the title. He also claimed that Mourinho will be happy with a draw. ‘It’s still possible, I’ve said that before,’ he added. ‘It is not logical but it is possible. It’s more when and if, and I don’t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. ‘But, alright, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal so we can lay pressure on Chelsea’s shoulders. You never know, you’ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons. So I cannot say it is not possible, but it is not logical. ‘They play at home but I think that Chelsea will be satisfied with a draw. Of course they will want to beat Manchester United and we want to beat them, the question is how long players can play in the discipline. Robin van Persie (back right) has only been training with United for a week but may return to feature . ‘We live for these titles, we are doing this for that. The only satisfaction you have as a manager is when you win a title. When you are second or third you can play Champions League, but a title is more fixed for you and you have your name on it. That’s why managers are fixated on titles. When you reach that goal you are happy. ______ That is why I’m still a manager because I don’t have to work anymore – you can count on that. I like to work with young people and help them in their career.’ Van Gaal gave a young Mourinho his break in coaching at Barcelona. Asked to compare the Portuguese with his current assistant Ryan Giggs, the United boss admitted that he has been surprised by the Old Trafford legend’s work ethic. He said: ‘It’s always difficult. People compare with each other because Jose Mourinho was not the world-class player that Ryan Giggs was. So that’s the same thing with me. I was not as world-class as, for example, Johann Cruyff yet our ambition is maybe then higher. ‘But I have to admit that I could not imagine when I spoke with him (Giggs) in May or June to ask him to be my assistant manager and we spoke about how we saw it, that he works very hard. As an ex-player you are not used to working very hard and he is a very hard worker, and he reads the game very well like Jose. But to manage a group you have to work, and what I can see is that he’s learning quickly.’ Chris Smalling celebrates after netting the fourth goal in the comprehensive victory at Old Trafford .","‘To be involved in the game with young people to reach a goal, that is also a goal of mine.","Luke Shaw could potentially return to the left back position for Manchester United despite not featuring well in recent games, and Marin Cw mighty looking to continue his impressive form against Chelsea.",0.826751709,0.8422688842,0.8344381452,0.1538461538,0.0,0.1153846154,0.1153846154

Pietersen’s quest for an improbable return to international cricket began as his scriptwriter must have known it would: with sumptuous strokes, a standing ovation and much of the old bravado. The fact that his first hundred since the Old Trafford Test against Australia in August 2013 came against a modest attack, at a windswept Oxford, in a game not deemed first-class, is beside the point. Pietersen’s only hope of playing for England again is to score lots of runs for Surrey – wind, rain or shine. Here was the first box ticked, in style. Surrey's Kevin Pietersen (right) celebrates reaching his 100 during the three-day Match at The Parks . Pietersen makes his way out to the crease following the dismissal of Rory Burns . It was the 34-year-old's first appearance for Surrey since the LV= County Championship in June 2013 . Asked what Graves had said to him when the pair spoke over the phone last month, Pietersen replied: ‘He said he wants the best players playing for England, and everyone has a clean slate. Right now, it’s just about me hitting the red ball. I think it can help England going forward. ‘I took confidence from the way I played in Australia [at the Big Bash]. It was as well as I’ve ever batted. ______ Regardless, the evidence here – as if it were required – suggested he is deadly serious about reclaiming his place. Pietersen has played exclusively Twenty20 cricket throughout the world since being axed by England . A young spectator points to a dent in her mother's car made by one of Pietersen's shots . Pietersen made 62 on his only prior appearance at The Parks, for Nottinghamshire in April 2004 . With Surrey 122 for five at lunch, Pietersen (left) found himself on 47 not out from 58 balls . Nearly 10 years on from his Ashes-clinching century at The Oval, Pietersen cannot have imagined he would need to prosper in the Parks simply to stay afloat. But in front of a crowd of several hundred – almost unheard of in these parts – and with Surrey stumbling to 113 for five, he had a captive audience and a job to do. Pietersen was careful at first, waiting until his eighth delivery to pinch his first run in red-ball cricket since the Sydney Test of January 2014, and not finding the boundary until his 31st. Then he opened up. His fifty came from 63 balls, his hundred from 110, and his 150 from 137. By the time he was out for 170, caught at mid-on off the bowling of Abidine Sahande, a human sciences undergrad from St John’s College, the total was only 310. He knocked one spectator off his stool with a fierce drive, dented a Peugeot 207 with the first of two successive straight sixes, and unveiled his full repertoire. Stealing headlines and causing damage, Pietersen might never have been away. Pietersen's inclusion in Surrey's line-up attracted several hundred spectators and a number of photographers .","I’ve been given a lifeline, and I have an opportunity to get back to doing something I love that was taken away from me prematurely.’ England meet West Indies in Antigua on Monday, and comparisons will be inevitable. There will be mixed feelings both in the Caribbean and at Lord’s. Whether Pietersen’s journey will prove more futile than fruitful is another matter. The first aim of the new regime at the ECB has been to stop the sniping; the second may be to keep Pietersen sweet in case English cricket needs him after he retires, possibly in a mentoring capacity.","“Regardless, the evidence here – as if it were required – suggested he is deadly serious about reclaiming his place.

Vettel was downcast, but said that the race may be a different story from qualifying. Hamilton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough.

McLaren will be towards the back of the grid. Jenson Button will start 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the two former champions. A naturally disappointed Button said: 'The car didn't feel bad so it's interesting when you find a good balance but the lap time is not there. We've made good improvements this weekend, but qualifying just wasn't for us. 'Hopefully we'll be racing the cars in front tomorrow, but we hoped to be competing with them in qualifying as well.'

Cristiano Ronaldo was back to his brilliant, unplayable best as he scored five goals in Real Madrid's 9-1 rout of Granada on Sunday, among them an eight-minute hat-trick. That treble was Ronaldo's 31st career hat-trick and his 24th in La Liga, equalling Lionel Messi's record in the competition. It also took his formidable goal tally for the Bernabeu club to 299 in 287 matches. Against Granada, Ronaldo has now scored 11 times in just eight matches. But, compared with some, they have got off quite lightly. We take a look at the clubs who have suffered the most at the hands of the Portuguese wonder. Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals as Real Madrid thrashed Granada 9-1 on Sunday afternoon . The Portuguese superstar was simply irresistible as Real ran riot at the Bernabeu . SEVILLA - 18 Goals in 12 matches . There's no denying it - Ronaldo just loves playing against Sevilla, whose defence must be terrified every time they see him. Three of those La Liga hat-tricks have come against the team from Andalusia - he scored triples in a 6-2 win at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in May 2011, a 4-1 success at the Bernabeu in February 2013 and a 7-3 thrashing in October of the same year. But they aren't even Ronaldo's best return. He scored four goals, including a 12-minute hat-trick, in another 6-2 win in Seville back in May 2011. Most recently, Ronaldo scored twice in Real's 2-0 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla in August. Ronaldo celebrates with James Rodriguez after scoring in Real's 2014 UEFA Super Cup win over Sevilla . ATLETICO MADRID - 15 Goals in 20 matches . Madrid derbies have been pretty common in recent years - not only in La Liga but also in the Copa del Rey (they're met in four of the last five seasons) and, of course, last season's Champions League final. In the 2011-12 league fixtures, Ronaldo scored twice against Atleti at the Bernabeu and three times against them at Vicente Calderon. Both matches ended in 4-1 wins for Real. But the most famous was in Lisbon last May, when Ronaldo scored Real's fourth in the Champions League final and ran off for that shirtless celebration. Ronaldo whips off his shirt to celebrate scoring the fourth goal in Real's 2014 Champions League final win . BARCELONA - 15 Goals in 26 matches . As a Manchester United player, Ronaldo failed to score in five meetings with Barcelona but that soon changed when he switched to Real Madrid in 2009. Scored: 417 goals . Against: 82 clubs . He scored an extra-time header to win the Copa del Rey final of 2011 and claim his first piece of silverware at the Bernabeu. And the Clasico goals have flowed regularly since - Ronaldo has scored seven against Barca in the league, five in the Copa del Rey and three in the Supercopa. With Ronaldo and Messi in a never-ending 'anything you can do' contest, there should be many more to come. Lionel Messi was left scratching his head after Ronaldo scored in the Clasico last October . GETAFE - 15 Goals in nine matches . Ronaldo really has it in for Getafe with an excellent scoring ratio against Madrid's city rivals. He notched hat-tricks against them in both the 2010-11 season and the 2012-13 campaign and added two more in a 3-0 Real win when the sides met at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez back in January. I doubt Getafe are looking forward to their last-day visit to the Bernabeu very much... Ronaldo celebrates after scoring against Getafe at the Bernabeu in May 2011 . ATHLETIC BILBAO - 14 Goals in 12 matches . Another team Ronaldo averages better than a goal a game against is Bilbao. He topped up his impressive record against the Basques with a hat-trick in a 5-0 home win earlier this season. That was the second time he has scored three against them - the other came in a 5-1 Bernabeu victory in November 2010. Ronaldo also registered doubles in a 4-1 win in January 2012 and a 3-0 win at San Mames in April 2013. Ronaldo heads home Real's second goal against Athletic Bilbao in a La Liga meeting in September 2013 . MALAGA - 13 Goals in 13 matches . Ronaldo has Malaga in the crosshairs too, averaging a goal a game in his 13 encounters with them. He has scored two hat-tricks against them, in a 7-0 demolition at the Bernabeu in March 2011 and a 4-0 success at La Rosaleda in October the same year. It almost came as a surprise when Ronaldo failed to find the net against them back in November - but he did contribute two assists instead. Ronaldo wheels away in celebration after scoring against Malaga back in January 2010 . CELTA VIGO - 12 goals in six matches . Ronaldo's best scoring ratio is against Celta Vigo where he has an incredible average of two goals a game. Admittedly, there have only been six games since Celta returned to the top flight but nearly all of them have been messy. Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 3-0 home win earlier this season and he also scored three in a Copa del Rey tie in January 2013. Indeed, Ronaldo has scored every time he's faced them. Ronaldo averages two goals a game against Celta Vigo - including this one in December 2014 . LEVANTE - 12 Goals in 11 matches . Levante have also served as target practice for Ronaldo too over the years, with the goals coming at regular intervals. Earlier this season, Ronaldo helped himself to two as Real routed them 5-0 at the Ciutat de Valencia. A Copa del Rey tie in December 2010 saw Ronaldo score three of Real's eight strikes. On target for Real in an away La Liga match with Levante back in November 2012 . VILLARREAL - 11 Goals in 13 matches . After drawing a blank four times against Villarreal with Manchester United, Ronaldo has well and truly made up for lost time. He has scored 11 times in nine La Liga encounters, including a hat-trick in a 4-2 home win in January 2011 (plus an assist for good measure). Ronaldo extended his scoring streak against the Yellow Submarine this season, netting both home and away. A high-five for Gareth Bale after scoring against Villarreal earlier this season. The game ended 2-2 . GRANADA - 11 Goals in eight matches . Ronaldo sliced through the Granada defence on Sunday like a knife through butter, registering the first five-goal haul of his career. He also took his impressive tally against this particular opponent to 11 goals in eight outings. Ronaldo points to the heavens after scoring for Real Madrid against Granada last season . RONALDO AGAINST THE ENGLISH TEAMS . Ronaldo's prolific scoring record against the Spanish clubs means you have to go down to No 16 on the overall list to find the Premier League opponent he has scored most against. It's Aston Villa - Ronaldo scored nine times in 14 matches against them during his time with Manchester United. He also has eight in 16 meetings with Tottenham Hotspur. But how about the leading teams in England? ARSENAL - Six goals in 15 matches . Ronaldo mustered half a dozen goals for Manchester United against the Gunners during his six seasons at Old Trafford. The most significant were the two at the Emirates to deliver United into the 2009 Champions League final, while he also scored twice in a 4-2 success at Highbury in February 2005. Ronaldo celebrates his stunning free-kick for Manchester United in the Champions League semi with Arsenal . MANCHESTER CITY - Five goals in 13 matches . Ronaldo scored four times in Manchester derbies during his time at Old Trafford - and also found the target against City for Real Madrid in a 2012 Champions League tie. His most telling contribution was a penalty at the Etihad in May 2007 as United beat their rivals 1-0 en route to the Premier League title. A youthful Ronaldo scored twice as United beat City 4-2 in an FA Cup tie in February 2004 . LIVERPOOL - Three goals in 11 matches . Ronaldo has struggled for goals against Liverpool - scoring twice against them for United and then adding another in Real's 3-0 win at Anfield earlier this season. That was his first time scoring at Anfield as the other two came at Old Trafford in contrasting circumstances - a 3-0 win in March 2008 and a 4-1 loss in March 2009. Ronaldo draws the ire of the Anfield crowd after scoring there for Real Madrid earlier this season . MANCHESTER UNITED - Two goals in two matches . Ronaldo came back to haunt Sir Alex Ferguson and United by scoring in both legs of their 2013 Champions League last-16 tie. His header cancelled out Danny Welbeck's opener in the Bernabeu and he then scored the decisive goal at Old Trafford - refusing to celebrate - after Nani had been sent off for United. Ronaldo refused to celebrate after scoring the goal that knocked Man United out of Europe in 2013 . CHELSEA - One goal in 15 matches . Ronaldo's record against Chelsea is poor - having found the net just once against the London side in 15 appearances. Mind you, it was an incredibly important one, a header in the 2008 Champions League final as United claimed their third European Cup triumph. Ronaldo towers above the Chelsea defence to head home during the 2008 Champions League final . 18 - Sevilla . ______ 11 - Villarreal, Granada . 10 - Osasuna . 9 - Aston Villa, Valencia, Rayo Vallecano, Real Sociedad, Deportivo . 8 - Tottenham . 7 - Schalke, Ajax, Zaragoza, Mallorca, Elche, Almeria, Fulham, Wigan . 6 - Racing Santander, Galatasaray, Arsenal, Bolton, Newcastle, Portsmouth . 5 - Everton, Manchester City, West Ham, Middlesbrough . 4 - Bayern Munich, Marseille, Lyon, Xerez, Espanyol, Derby, West Brom, Reading . 3 - FC Copenhagen, Borussia Dortmund, Roma, Juventus, CSKA Moscow, Real Betis, Valldolid, Dinamo Moscow, Liverpool, Blackburn . 2 - Ludogorets, AC Milan, Sporting Lisbon, Basle, Zurich, Eibar, Gijon, Hercules, APOEL, Southampton, Birmingham, Stoke, Hull, Manchester United, Watford . 1 - Auxerre, Inter, Gamba Osaka, Porto, Murcia, Tenerife, Cordoba, Ponferradina, Debreceni, Sunderland, Charlton, Chelsea, Millwall, Exeter .","15 - Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Getafe . 14 - Atletico Bilbao . 13 - Malaga . 12 - Celta Vigo, Levante .",The content you've provided appears to be a ranking of Cristiano Ronaldo's goals scored by opposition teams that he faced during his time at Manchester United and other clubs.,0.8078814149,0.7828484178,0.795167923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

England's exiled record run-scorer made 170 off 149 balls against MCC Universities Oxford at The Parks on Sunday, at the start of Surrey's three-day fixture. Former England captains Alec Stewart, Pietersen's boss as Surrey director of cricket, and Nasser Hussain have since both had their say on the 34-year-old's chances of a return to the Test arena. Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey on day two of the three-day match against Oxford MCCU . Pietersen (centre) pictured with his Surrey team-mates at The Parks on Monday . Stewart is hoping Pietersen can further his quest when Surrey face Glamorgan in their first LV= County Championship fixture next week - while Hussain insists England's selectors need to clarify with a 'very public decision' once and for all whether the controversial South Africa-born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again. Pietersen's impressive return to long-form cricket 14 months after his England sacking was timely, on the eve of the first Test against the West Indies which began 4,000 miles away in Antigua on Monday. Stewart said: 'Anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors. 'Kevin shouldn't look any further than the next innings, whether it's here or down at Cardiff. 'If he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds, double-hundreds, help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to. 'No one has got any idea whether Kevin Pietersen will play for England again. 'The only people that know that are those who are currently picking the England side. 'At the moment he's not being considered, because he hasn't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months.' Pietersen chills out against the fence as Oxford MCCU bat on Monday . Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors . Hussain is impressed that Pietersen has already proved he is serious about a recall, and he is adamant the England and Wales Cricket Board must 'watch out' for him. 'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.' Hussain senses Pietersen will not be easily deterred, unless England spell out that they do not want him. 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. ______ Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday . Pietersen fielding on Monday afternoon as the 34-year-old makes his county cricket return . He hopes Pietersen can boost Surrey's championship promotion prospects, and was encouraged by his comeback. 'It was a very good innings,' Stewart added. 'He had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up, letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is, which we all know but we just haven't seen it because he's only played 20-over cricket. 'We've signed Kevin because he's a top-class player. 'Will he play for England? We don't know. All we're going to do is enjoy having Kevin around, scoring as many runs as he can. 'Next game, next innings, is the next most important one.' Pietersen had a quieter second day back in his whites. He fielded at mid-off and slip as Surrey's hosts dug in after resuming on 28 for four. Jack McIver top-scored with 83, hitting 11 fours and a six, in the students' 224 all out. Chris Tremlett, another England Test player, took five for 30. Surrey reshuffled their batting order in the second innings, and Pietersen was left to watch on as they reached 182 for three - Zafar Ansari making 53 towards a lead of 378 entering Tuesday's final day.","'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.'","1.

Cook has had a taste already of what is to come, first of all in three Caribbean Tests this month and then a decidedly awkward assignment at home to New Zealand, before England somehow try this summer to regain the Ashes lost 5-0 under his captaincy in 2013-14.

As Cook, Moores and their playing and management colleagues reconvened at Gatwick Airport on Thursday, the captain's first task was to field questions on a series of topics unlikely to go away any time soon. He made 79 in his last Test innings, part of a wide-margin and third successive victory at home to India last summer, and will be a record-breaker for the foreseeable future as England's most prolific centurion. It was Cook himself, however, who helpfully pointed out those facts will be irrelevant when he next walks out to open the innings for his country. Before and after that moment, he will be beset by the endless stream of enquiries - about his own poor form of the past two years, his and Moores' future, the remarks of outspoken new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves ... and, of course, Kevin Pietersen. Alastair Cook smiles while fielding during England's Test series with India last summer . Cook bats during the fifth Test against India at The Oval last year . The speculation over whether Kevin Pietersen will return to the England fold will overshadow the tour . The wonder is whether Cook can clear his mind sufficiently to defend his wicket against the new ball, or dispatch a wide one. That ability, though, is what sets apart batsmen of his calibre - and he can only keep telling himself he has the track record to prove it. 'That's what I've got to do ... at the top of the order you're paid to score runs, and I'd love to get back to that. 'Every time you go out to bat you start on nought. ______ Cook struggled for form playing for the MCC against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi last month . Cook will hope England can regain the Ashes when they face Australia later this summer . The tinsel could barely have been in place around him, wife Alice and their baby daughter at their rural home before he discovered he would be staying on well into the new year after all. Back to work last week, after England's World Cup embarrassment without him and off his own bat after those two brief innings for MCC against champion county Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi, Cook could do little else than try to impart a little positive spin on events. 'It's been a different couple of months from what I thought I would have before Christmas. 'Every cloud has a huge silver lining, and spending three months at home has been fantastic. 'It's been living a normal life again - which I haven't had for quite a long time - and it's been great, spending time with family and friends and being at home. 'It's been refreshing, but the challenge now is that a lot's gone on since that last win against India at The Oval. Cook pictured in conversation with England head coach Peter Moores during a nets session on Sunday . Cook (centre) takes part in a fielding drill at Warner Park in Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis . 'To say we can get back there straight away is going to be a challenge for the players and for the leadership, with me and Mooresy, to try to do that.' It is a moot point whether Graves' words will help them or not. He spelled out in the weeks before England's first venture of an outrageously hectic year that, should Cook's tourists fail to beat the 'mediocre' opposition they are set to face in the Windies, there will be 'inquiries'. Encouraged or otherwise by that, Cook is experienced enough to know - especially after England's disappointments and struggles since they won their last home Ashes series - that success will be hard-earned and is no foregone conclusion. Reminded of the chairman's synopsis, he said: 'Anyone who has to cross over the line and face 90 mph bowling from Kemar Roach will have a different view of that. 'We know that winning any series away from home will take a lot of skill and effort.'","'The record you have in the past counts for nothing when you walk out there.' Cook waved what he hoped would be a brief goodbye to Moores, less than a week before turning 30 on Christmas Day, still apparently full of optimism - despite an unsuccessful tour of Sri Lanka - that he would be retained to complete the task he had been set three-and-a-half years earlier, to lead England to the World Cup.","According to the text, the complete sentences are:

201927,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l3,4207,0,4,"Louis van Gaal says the prospect of facing Aston Villa scared him more than the idea of taking on Manchester City at Old Trafford. United will be looking to end a run of four successive Manchester derby defeats on Sunday when City make the short trip across town. Van Gaal lost his first encounter with United's closest rivals last November, when Sergio Aguero struck the only goal in a 1-0 win for the Blues. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal insists he is not worried about the prospect of his side facing Man City . Van Gaal, pictured with Juan Mata on Friday, believes Man City will not be as defensive-minded as Aston Villa . ______ 'I don't expect Manchester City shall play so defensive as Aston Villa. Then you need a lot of focus and concentration on our defence. 'A long ball is very difficult to defend. But (against) Manchester City, I don't expect very much long balls. 'It's another game and that's why I have less fear against Manchester City in spite of losing 1-0 against them in the last game.' Ander Herrera scored two goals as Manchester United picked up all three points against Aston Villa . Sergio Aguero scored the only goal of the match during this season's previous Manchester derby . That is not to say he would not cherish his first win over City. 'I dream of it, every player shall dream of the victory,' the United boss said. During his nine months in charge, assistant manager Ryan Giggs and club chef Mike Donnelly have taught the Dutchman about United's rivalries. But if he needed a reminder of the enmity between City and United, he got it this week from his wife Truus, whose hairdresser is a blue. 'I'm not so often in the city, but when I am there, the people are talking about the derby and even when I come home my wife is saying the things they have told her about this derby,' Van Gaal told MUTV. 'My wife's hairdresser is a Manchester City fan so there is a lot of discussion between these two women. 'I like it. You play football for the fans and I hope we can give our fans the victory.' Bragging rights are not the only thing at stake. Victory would strengthen United's grip on third place as they would then be four points clear of their 'noisy neighbours'. A third-placed finish would guarantee direct entry into the Champions League and that is what Van Gaal is aiming for. 'When you win, third place is then reachable and a month ago nobody was thinking about that, besides me, of course,' Van Gaal said. 'Third is good because you are certainly qualified for the Champions League and then we do better than the goal that was set in pre-season.' Chris Smalling was sent off during his side's defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in November . Smalling is heckled by Manchester City supporters as he makes his way off the field . The fact that United and City are effectively battling for third position shows how disappointing their seasons have been. But Van Gaal has warned he will be setting out to land the top prize next year, after making a few additions to his squad. 'I want to improve my selection for the next season. Then we can make a bigger step,' he said. 'Sir Alex Ferguson has done it before. Jose Mourinho is doing it now. 'Last season he didn't win anything. Now he is winning the title, now I try to do that also.' United's run of five straight league victories has moved them above City, who have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions. The fact that City have had the edge on their rivals recently does not seem to bother the Dutchman though. 'That's not my history,' he said. 'The last game we played against them and we had a red card in the 39th minute - that is my history.' Chris Smalling was the man who was dismissed at the Etihad Stadium. The defender earned his first booking for blocking Joe Hart as he went to kick the ball out of his hands, and he was cautioned for a second time for clumsily hacking down James Milner. Van Gaal will remind his players they must stay on the pitch this weekend. He said: 'In such games always you have to control your aggression and we did not do that then, so I hope we have learned from that moment. 'We have had five red cards this year. It's a record in my career as a manager and that's not good.'","Manchester United are currently one point ahead of local rivals Manchester City . But Van Gaal is confident of victory this weekend, stating that he thinks City's attacking tendencies will work in United's favour. Van Gaal believes teams that come to Old Trafford looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat. Van Gaal is so sure of that theory that he spent less time fretting about Sunday's opposition than he did last week when relegation-threatened Villa came to Old Trafford.

Struggled from the start, looking uncomfortable on the ball and he picked up a hamstring problem. Substituted after losing out to Rhodes. Lovren 6.5 .

Comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do. Alberto Moreno had a comfortable evening on the whole with Blackburn lacklustre down the right. Little to do . Lucas 6 . Provided a solid base in midfield and moved the ball around well but not much penetration as Liverpool toiled in first half. Allen 5.5 .

Philippe Coutinho was the star man in Liverpool's midfield again, and his goal sends them to Wembley . Henderson 6.5 . His one-two with Coutinho set up the winner but his deliveries from dead-balls left much to be required at times. Sterling 6.5 . One of Liverpool's main threats as usual, playing down the left at Ewood Park. Impact blunted as Blackburn doubled up. Booked. Sturridge 5 . He's not back at his best yet and it showed. Seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times and was restricted to shots from distance. Daniel Sturridge is not back at his best yet and it showed. He seemed uneasy in taking on defenders at times . Subs . Toure 7.5 (for Sakho 26) Solid in defence with Lovren, he ably deputised when Liverpool had to reshuffle early on and dealt with Gestede and Rhodes. Lambert (for Sturridge 85) No time. Headed first touch wide. REFEREE: . Kevin Friend 7 . Did all that could be expected of him. Missed Allen handball shout after Ben Marshall's header but that would have been harsh. Ignored penalty shout from same player in stoppage time. MAN OF THE MATCH: . Philippe Coutinho . A mercurial performance topped off with an excellent goal to decide the game.

Police investigated the incident after receiving complaints from furious web users, but have now passed on the case to the club to investigate. Liverpool FC said in a statement: 'Last month, Liverpool Football Club received complaints of a tweet showing an image of Muslim fans praying during half-time at Anfield accompanied by comments that were offensive to the complainants.

Arsenal had fought back from two down against Hull and 108 minutes had elapsed when Ramsey fired his side into a 3-2 lead before going off on a celebratory sprint which he ended flat on his back, exhausted, beneath a pile of jubilant team-mates. ‘I was knackered,’ smiled Ramsey. ‘We were in extra-time and my celebration, I didn’t really know what to do. I was just running about and it all caught up on me then so I needed a couple of seconds just to get my breath back and realise just what I’d just actually done. It was definitely overwhelming. And it was a great way to finish the season for me personally and for the team finally to win something. It was an amazing feeling.

My dream was always scoring a goal in the FA Cup final and I had managed to live my dream. Then to see how much it meant to people when a quarter of a million came out on the streets the next day. It was a beautiful day and you could see everyone was in it together.’ Ramsey had played in the 2008 FA Cup final for Cardiff aged 17, but his winners’ medal now takes pride of place in a display cabinet in the study at his home. ‘I’ve a few shirts in there, my debut shirt at Cardiff, the FA Cup winners’ shirt, some boots to mark my achievements,’ said Ramsey. ‘And there’s a big desk in there which I never use. The Welshman looks chuffed as he sets his eyes on the gleaming silverware he helped earn his side . Goalscorer Ramsey hugs his FA Cup following his goal against Hull City at Wembley in 2014 . More than a quarter of a million fans took to the streets to celebrates Arsenal's 2014 FA Cup success . ‘That feeling you get after winning is difficult to get. Everyone realised we wanted more. We are putting pressure on ourselves to get the best from each other and I feel we’ve done that in the second half of this season. ‘We’ve really stuck by each other, worked hard for each other and we want another feeling like we had last season. We do push ourselves as a team and I think the title is getting closer. Last season we started really well and maybe faded away. We lost against the bigger teams, but this season we’ve done better against them. This season, we didn’t start too well but the second half has been really good and consistent. I feel we are very close.’ If Chelsea collapse against the odds in the title race, Arsenal are best placed to pounce after a run of 33 points from a dozen Barclays Premier League games since New Year’s Day. ‘That’s still a possibility,’ said Ramsey. ‘You can’t rule it out. You can’t. When you have that momentum, it is still possible. Even though it will be difficult we have to win our remaining games and see where that leaves us. ‘It’s going to be difficult. Chelsea have a lot of points, so they will have to slip up a few times for us to catch them. So it will be difficult, but it’s still possible.’ His optimism reflects the mood in Arsenal’s camp, very different from this time last year when they went into an FA Cup semi-final stifled by the desperation to end the trophy-free years and Arsene Wenger’s uncertain future. They staggered past Wigan on penalties. Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski makes a save against Wigan Athletic during FA Cup semi final match . Fabianski's save helped Arsenal to progress to the FA Cup final which they won at Wembley in 2014 . Arsenal are stronger and more solid now, with more weaponry, flair and freedom than last year. But that does not mean they will swat Reading aside. ‘We probably did feel the pressure,’ admitted Ramsey. ‘But we got through and went on to win it and we haven’t got that sort of pressure now. That pressure is gone because we won something and there is no more of this “nine years”. ‘It’s a different sort of pressure, but one we’ve been up against many times when we’ve played lesser teams. It’s important not to take the game lightly. We just have to focus and if we manage ourselves correctly, we will go through.’ Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be hoping to add another piece of silverware to his collection .",Ramsey is joined by Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta during the FA Cup Final at Wembley in 2014 .,The blank is: One sentence only,0.8045476079,0.7747142315,0.7893491387,0.1739130435,0.0,0.0869565217,0.0869565217

Ricardo Quaresma (7) gave Porto an early lead from the spot but Manuel Neuer was lucky to be on the pitch .

And punching together.’ As he suggested, Hamilton had stood toe to toe with his countryman as opponents when their respective teams, Edinburgh and Glasgow, clashed. But, in the second row for Scotland, they would have each other’s backs as they fought — normally against the odds — for their country. Al Kellock will retire at the end of the season and take up a new role with the SRU . On Thursday, at the home of Glasgow, it was announced that this fierce warrior would be standing down from active service after a career that truly boasted blood, sweat and toil for both club and country. At 33 and having amassed 56 international caps and made over 200 appearances for Glasgow and Edinburgh, Kellock has decided that his body and mind have been put through enough. No one could deny that he deserves nothing but praise and admiration, although lifting the Pro12 title at the end of the season would also be a more than fitting send-off. And yet, it might never have been. As he reflected upon his career yesterday, Kellock admitted that the odds were stacked against him even being a rugby player as he grew up in football-mad Bishopbriggs. In fact, his local high school didn’t even have a rugby team. He began, unsurprisingly given his height, as a budding centre-half in the school football team and only saw a rugby ball when he trained on a Tuesday and Thursday night at Allan Glen’s RFC. However, encouraged by his parents, who drove him to training, the decision to choose the oval ball has never since been regretted. The record books will show that he skippered Scotland to their first ever Test series win in the southern hemisphere and led Glasgow Warriors into their first ever play-off final. And, of course, more history could yet be made. ‘To retire as Glasgow captain is good enough but if I could go out as the Glasgow captain who wins the Pro12 for the first time in our history would be fairy-tale stuff,’ said Kellock, who played his 150th game as skipper in the 34-34 draw at Leinster last Friday. ‘If you had told me when I was at school I would go on to achieve some of the things I have achieved, and have a chance to round things off by winning the league, I wouldn’t have believed you. Kellock amassed 56 international caps and made over 200 appearances for Glasgow and Edinburgh . ‘When I was starting out, I was one of very few people at my school who dreamed of playing at Murrayfield. All my school friends wanted to play at Hampden and, don’t get me wrong, as a west of Scotland guy I played an awful lot of football, too. ‘We only played rugby in a three- week block in PE once a year and during one of them, my teachers said I had potential and took me to Allan Glen’s. Even then, when I finished school, I always played football with my mates and never saw a rugby ball apart from when I went to the club for training two evenings a week. ‘I had to make the decision when I was nearly 16 to pick football or rugby as I couldn’t do both at weekends because they clashed. ‘Choosing rugby was the best decision of my life. ‘I was picked to go on a tour for state school pupils to Ireland, organised by Sean Lineen, and two years later I played for the Scottish Schools Under-18 side alongside the likes of Mike Blair and Rory Lawson. We didn’t have a school team at Bishopbriggs but the selectors must have seen something in me to give me the chance.’ What they saw was an inspirational leader who wasn’t afraid to put himself about the pitch. And, at 6ft 8in tall and 18st 7lb, he was a formidable opponent. Kellock moved from Allan Glen’s to Stirling County and from there he was awarded a professional contract with Edinburgh Rugby in 2002. He played 56 times for the capital club, before moving west in 2006. He was almost immediately awarded the Glasgow captaincy, a position he has held ever since. Kellock’s senior Scotland debut was in a non-cap tour game against Queensland Reds in 2004. Later that year he won the first of his 56 caps against Australia at Murrayfield. He had always insisted he would only retire when he thought his body couldn’t take much more and the number of injuries and operations he has had made him realise it was time to call it a day. ‘It was dreadful telling everyone I was retiring and it was a reflective time for me,’ said Kellock. ______ I will be pushing as hard as I can to be involved as much as I can in all our matches. ‘I know how well the young lads are playing but training will still have an edge to it, probably more of an edge, as I want to get a starting place and retire after lifting some silverware with Glasgow.’ Kellock has been handed a job within the Scottish Rugby Union similar to the one secured by Chris Paterson when he retired three years ago, which will make him a rugby ambassador north of the border travelling round clubs. He will also be involved in learning about the commercial and business aspects of the governing body and will also work with the players at Glasgow, such as young lock Jonny Gray. ‘The job the SRU has given me is brilliant as it allows me to learn different parts of the business,’ he said. ‘I am not ruling out doing more coaching work in the future. I am just saying, at the moment, I will be concentrating on the business side but will be mentoring players and helping them with their line-out work. ‘There are some top second-row players at the club like Jonny, who is a grafter and would run into a brick wall for the Glasgow cause. He calls the line-outs and is someone who keeps getting better. ‘Players like Jonny are responsible for the success of the club in recent years. When I first joined Glasgow, we were bringing in 1,500 people at Hughenden, but now we’re regularly exceeding 6,000 at Scotstoun, which makes me incredibly proud and happy to be part of the journey. ‘To have captained the side for nine years is such an honour and I have so many fantastic memories, such as beating Toulouse away from home in Europe and winning against Munster in the Pro12 semi-final last season when my daughter was mascot.’ Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend paid tribute to the role Kellock played in the continued improvement of the club both on and off the field. ‘Al has been instrumental in Glasgow’s rise over the past five or six years and he’s been an excellent role model for our values, with the work he does to improve himself, his team-mates and the club,’ said Townsend . ‘He is very passionate about rugby in Glasgow and it’s great that he’s moving into an important role with Scottish Rugby and Glasgow Warriors when he retires. ‘Al has put his body on the line a lot during his nine years with the club and he’s still competing very hard with the other second-rows to be selected ahead of them. He shows excellent leadership whether he plays or not and his first thought is how he can help the team win. ‘He has been an excellent person to work with. The ideal captain. He has left a fantastic legacy for the future of the club to continue to grow.’","‘There were some tears from my daughter and I would have loved to keep on playing but I knew it was time to call it a day. ‘I have had operations on my shoulder, elbow and will probably need one on my hand. I have had four knee operations and knew I needed to make one big, last push to try to help Glasgow to win the league this season and then call it quits. ‘I’m not going to go away easily as I want to play my part from now until the end of the season.","The blank is :

149017,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l0,3105,0,3,"Tiger Woods was genial. Tiger Woods was charm personified. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world. You can grin your way through life as the 111th best golfer in the world. No pressure. No big whoop. Judging by some of the stuff said and written about Woods in the build-up to his 20th Masters, it will be an achievement if he makes the cut. Very respected names have close to begged him not to compete. Woods doesn’t see it like that at all. He’s in it to win it. And it’s in those little moments that the old Tiger — some would argue the real Tiger — breaks cover again. Tiger Woods was all smiles as he played a practice around ahead of his 20th appearance at the Masters . The former best player in the world arrives at Augusta ranked a lowly 111th in the game . Woods name appears on the Masters' tournament winner's board four times; 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005 . It was all smiles and wise-cracks as Woods sat before the assembled press on Tuesday. Questions that would once have been greeted with terse disregard were warmly expanded upon. Memory lane was tripped down, the elder statesman played. He even referred to some of the correspondents in the room as his friends. And then he was asked where a win this week, from one ranking place lower than Tomohiro Kondo of Japan, at a point in his career when it was wondered whether he would be seen on the golf course as a competing professional again, would rank in his career achievements. And up leapt old Tiger. He didn’t answer this one with a short, evocative speech or a ready quip. He shut it down, old school. One sentence, no messing, no prospect of elaboration. ______ Brevity replaced levity. The questioner, gamely, tried again with a slight rephrase. ‘Long way to go before that,’ Woods replied. ‘Lot of work to do.’ He smiled. The chill passed. And, of course, that is exactly what it would be. Just his 15th major, if it signalled a true return to form. And on to the next one. World No 4 Jordan Spieth was in ninth grade — 14 years old — when Woods won his last major in 2008. But if he could win a fifth Masters he would be back in the game. And no more Mr Nice Guy, one feels. From 111th in the world, Woods has time to take the scenic route in conversation. Back to where he was, back to contending, he would be all business again. Not entirely like before, of course, because he could never go back to before — but not many of the guys who are genuinely fancied to be wearing the green jacket on Sunday night practised as Woods did, with partner and kids in tow. Woods gets a hug from his children,  Charlie and Sam, who will carry his bag for the par three tournament . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn leads the pair around the course to watch their father practice . Ski champion Vonn has a chat with tournament favourite Rory McIlroy during practice . As Woods putted, Lindsey Vonn, a world champion skier, clutched Charlie and Sam and chatted to a passing Rory McIlroy. The contrast was clear. McIlroy, whose easy manner and charisma require no effort, is not here to smell the azaleas. He is the world’s best golfer, on the brink of a third consecutive major in what would be a personal Grand Slam — only the sixth in the world to do it. He has a lot at stake. Woods is on bonus time. In January, he shot an 82, 11-over-par, at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, his worst round in close to 13 years. A week later, he walked off at Torrey Pines after 11 holes citing back problems. His partner that day, Chris DiMarco, thought it was more out of embarrassment. ‘He wasn’t doing anything good,’ he said. Woods then took an indefinite break from golf, with claims he had the chipping yips. On Monday he admitted being stuck between two release patterns, which amounts to the same thing. When he spoke of his journey to this point of return, it was clear he regards it as the second — maybe third, considering the events of 2009 — phase of his career. Woods shot the worst round of his professional career, an 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open . Woods speaks to the world's media after withdrawing from the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open . The 14 major winner stands at the tee as the Augusta course is mowed ahead of this year's tournament . ‘People would never understand how much work I put in to come back and do this again,’ he said. ‘I worked my ass off, that’s the easiest way to describe it. I worked hard. Sun up to sun down. When the kids were in school, I’d be doing it. When they went to sleep, still doing it. ‘The way I saw it, if I started when the sun came up I’d be a better player when it set. Getting better incrementally. It would come in flashes. It would come for 10 minutes and then I’d lose it for an hour. Then I’d get it back. Gradually, it flipped. I’d have it for an hour, lose it for 10 minutes. And then it was just there. There were some frustrating moments, but I had to stick with it. There were times when clubs flew, when a few suddenly slipped out of my hand — and travelled some good distances. ‘But we kept working, shot by shot, hour by hour. It was slow and steady, just taking little bits of progression. I had to hammer it out, make sure it was engrained. I just had to get through it.’ Woods smiles after winning his last major in a play-off with Rocco Mediate at the 2008 US Open . The all conquering American celebrates winning the Masters after sinking a play-off putt in 2005 . Nick Faldo slips the green jacket on Woods after he won his first major at the 1997 Masters . And now he’s through it. And America waits. For while nobody expects the player one better than Hennie Otto of South Africa to beat among the most competitive Masters fields in the modern era, that doesn’t mean there is not a desperate yearning for the impossible to happen. It doesn’t help that the man in Woods’s place is not Bubba Watson, or Rickie Fowler, or any of the other star spangled pretenders, but a 25-year-old from Belfast who plays for the wrong team when the Ryder Cup is on. America likes Rory, but it loves Tiger. His victories once caused a spike in Wall Street’s Monday morning figures, and golf’s television numbers have not recovered from his spell in recovery. So the positive lines in Woods’s Masters preparation are lapped up and thrown out as a potential feelgood hit of the summer. That’s why Woods is still, against all logic, asked about winning here. Why he plays the game, and talks about winning right back at them. ‘I prepare to win and expect to go and do that,’ he said. ‘I’ve come close in the last 10 years. Half of the tournaments since 2005 I had a chance on the back nine. I just didn’t get it done. For whatever reason, I didn’t seize the opportunity.’ The former champion has spoken of practicing his game from dawn until dusk to hone his swing . Woods latest comeback has sparked a tidal wave of interest from American supporters and beyond . The room seemed pleased with the answer. Woods was asked what, at 39, remained his greatest motivation. ‘Winning,’ deadpanned old Tiger, suddenly solemn. And then he smiled. ‘I like it,’ he said, before disappearing through a side door. Tiger Woods is the 111th best golfer in the world and entirely at ease with that. For now.","Woods has insisted that he would not enter a tournament unless he thought he had a chance of winning it .

Frank Knight, a lifelong supporter of the Seasiders, was ordered to make a public apology after posting a disparaging status on his Facebook page this time last year. Knight currently has 34 friends on his private account and this is the third instance in a matter of months whereby a fan of the club has settled before court proceedings with owner Owen Oyston and his son, chairman Karl. Blackpool fans vent their disgust at the Oyston family, who own the club, last week . ______ Karl Oyston is to soon find out his fate for branding a fan a ‘retard’ before Christmas, telling him to ‘enjoy your special needs day out’ and claiming he was banned from the ground because he was a ‘p****’. Blackpool’s recent history has been entrenched in bitter disputes off the pitch, with paying customers regularly protesting at the ownership of their club. That was compounded last week when Lee Clark and his team’s relegation to League One was confirmed. Dozens pelted the Bloomfield Road reception with eggs and flares before their draw against Reading last Tuesday.

Blackpool fan Frank Knight posted an apology on a supporters' messageboard on Thursday . A group also travelled to the Oyston home near Waddington, Lancashire on Sunday to vent their fury. Members of the family stood within the grounds and watched as they protested in front of the gates. And Knight’s apology will only serve to exasperate the problem further. Posting on a fans’ messageboard, the pensioner said: ‘I now regret making these allegations, I fully accept that they are false and I wish to sincerely apologise for them and also for the harm, distress and financial losses my comments have caused both BFC and the Oystons and I wish to unreservedly withdraw them. ‘I accept that my publication of the allegations on Facebook and in a manner which is readily accessible to users constitutes a very serious libel.

Aitor Karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from Watford were it not for the probability they’d spend most of the journey travelling in circles. This was that kind of game, a top-of-the-table occasion when Middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale – they did not create, they did not contain. They might have survived with deficiencies in one department, but not both. What a cruel time to deliver one of their worst performances of a brilliant season. What a cruel time for the Championship’s best defence to explode at the seams. Odion Ighalo's shot flies into the top corner of Dimi Konstantopoulos' net on 65 minutes . Watford (3-5-2): Gomes; Cathcart (Connolly 60), Angella, Hoban; Paredes, Guedioura (Layun 90), Watson, Tozser, Anya; Deeney, Ighalo (Vydra 69). Subs not used: Bond, Pudil, Munari, Abdi. Booked: Guedioura, Layun. Goals: Deeney 37, Ighalo 65. Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Tiendalli (Kalas 63), Woodgate, Amorebieta, Friend; Leadbitter, Clayton (Forshaw 84); Adomah, Tomlin (Kike 62), Reach; Bamford. Subs not used: Ripley, Gibson, Whitehead, Vossen. Booked: Reach. Referee: Mike Jones (Cheshire) Attendance: 19,656. They gifted Troy Deeney his 20th goal of the season and they contributed significantly to Odion Ighalo scoring his 19th in the second half. With that, Watford rose and Middlesbrough fell. That has been the way of this remarkable season in this peculiar division, for which everyone and no-one has staked a claim. The Championship lead which Boro held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times, with Watford back in prominence and Karanka sounding like a man searching for a positive note. Karanka said: ‘The players are completely destroyed but I am very proud of them. We have players who have come from League One and other teams in the Championship, a lot of young players, and we are fighting with the best teams in the Championship. No one could have expected this position. ‘The people who know me and this team know we will fight to the last second. I don’t want to forget our position is amazing.’ True enough, but the reality is Boro have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot. They were woeful in falling at Bournemouth last month and have now lost four of their past five away games. Jonathan Woodgate slides in vain to try and block Troy Deeney's opening goal . The Watford captain managed to slide the ball under Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos . Deeney celebrates with his team-mates after giving Watford a first-half lead . But their misery has been Watford’s gain. What a luxury to have two strikers as effective as Deeney and Ighalo. They were, as Karanka said, ‘the difference’. ______ Here, they had help. In the first instance, for Deeney’s 37th-minute opener, Jonathan Woodgate and Dwight Tiendalli made a hash of the basics. Adlene Guedioura was given too much time to cross from the right and Woodgate misread the flight, allowing the ball to fall in the space behind him. Tiendalli could have covered but was out of position. At this level, in that situation, there can be fewer worse sights for a pair of defenders than Deeney. His touch was perfect and so was the finish - ruthless brilliance from a striker who has now scored 20 goals in each of his past three campaigns. He is the only Watford player in history to do that; he more than most deserves a chance to see what he can do at the higher level. ‘He’s a Premier League player,’ said Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic. ‘It’s just a question of whether we are all together as a Premier League team.’ Watford made it 2-0 with 25 minutes to go. Again, the ease with which Ighalo turned Woodgate will have bothered Karanka, as will Grant Leadbitter’s sloppy concession of the ball in the build-up. But, really, it was all about the finish, the striker’s shot hitting the top corner from the edge of the area. Ighalo said he only joined Watford for the prospect of Premier League football. He might just get it. Jokanovic said: ‘I expect this victory can help us to win points a little bit more easily in the future. But in front of us is a very serious job.’ Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes gets a boot to the face from Middlesbrough forward Patrick bamford .

In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. ______ 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.",I have the women's game on my shoulders.

The Centurions twice came from behind in thrilling fashion to beat the Red Devils 22-18 in front of a 6,358 crowd at Leigh Sports Village and stretch their winning run to 21 matches. The build-up to the fifth-round tie was dominated by the selection by Leigh of former England forward Gareth Hock despite an agreement not to play against his old club, but he played little part in their downfall. Unbeaten Championship leaders Leigh delivered a stunning knockout blow as Super League club Salford crashed out of the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup . Hock, one of five ex-Salford players in the home line-up, spent just 25 minutes on the field in two spells and looked well short of match fitness. Instead it was left to former Wigan hooker Bob Beswick to orchestrate a magnificent display by Paul Rowley's men, who trailed 6-0 and 18-12 to their Super League visitors, who were badly hit by injuries and indebted to a superb performance from French half-back Theo Fages for keeping them in contention right to the end. The match was played amid a wonderful atmosphere and the ferocity was in evidence inside the first minute when Salford forward Cory Paterson was placed on report for a high and late tackle on Leigh full-back Gregg McNally. Fages opened the scoring after seven minutes when he dummied his way over for the first try and his half-back partner Michael Dobson kicked the conversion before hurting his knee in a collision four minutes later. Dobson attempted to play on but eventually succumbed to his injury and the Red Devils also lost centre Junior Sa'u with a wrist injury before half-time. ______ Beswick was the provider each time, a short pass getting veteran forward Tommy Goulden over from close range while McNally finished off his break from halfway, and Martyn Ridyard kicked both conversions. That was the signal for Hock to enter the fray but Salford turned the tables with two tries either side of the break from Niall Evalds to retake the lead. They drew level on 34 minutes when Fages broke clear to get the full-back over for his first try and got his over again three minutes into the second half courtesy of a neat reverse pass. Paterson kicked both goals to make it 18-12 and Leigh missed a glorious chance to level matters when centre Tom Armstrong got winger Liam Kay haring for the corner only for him to lose the ball in Fages' last-ditch tackle. Just when Salford seemed to be in control, the game took a new twist as Leigh stormed back in front. They were thrown a lifeline on 63 minutes when Salford winger Ben Jones-Bishop's careless pass was snapped up by Leigh half-back Ryan Brierley for a gift of a try. Ridyard's third goal tied the scores and the Centurions regained the lead three minutes later McNally fashioned a try for winger Johnathan Pownall. There was no shortage of action right to the end but Leigh, who pushed Leeds all the way in last year's quarter-final, hung on and just about deserved their famous victory.","With Paterson also limping, the visitors were rocked by the flair and determination of their Championship opponents, who scored two tries in four minutes to go 12-6 ahead.",The correct answer is: Bob Beswick was the key player in securing the dramatic comeback victory for Leigh as she introduced Tommy Goulden and then backlined Johnathan Pownall but ultimately sealed the 13-12 victory in Super League.,0.8323452473,0.8568723798,0.8444308043,0.1492537313,0.0,0.1194029851,0.1194029851

England's exiled record run-scorer made 170 off 149 balls against MCC Universities Oxford at The Parks on Sunday, at the start of Surrey's three-day fixture. Former England captains Alec Stewart, Pietersen's boss as Surrey director of cricket, and Nasser Hussain have since both had their say on the 34-year-old's chances of a return to the Test arena. Kevin Pietersen in action for Surrey on day two of the three-day match against Oxford MCCU . Pietersen (centre) pictured with his Surrey team-mates at The Parks on Monday . Stewart is hoping Pietersen can further his quest when Surrey face Glamorgan in their first LV= County Championship fixture next week - while Hussain insists England's selectors need to clarify with a 'very public decision' once and for all whether the controversial South Africa-born batsman has any prospects of playing for his adopted country again. Pietersen's impressive return to long-form cricket 14 months after his England sacking was timely, on the eve of the first Test against the West Indies which began 4,000 miles away in Antigua on Monday. Stewart said: 'Anyone who scores runs will ask questions of the selectors. 'Kevin shouldn't look any further than the next innings, whether it's here or down at Cardiff. 'If he strings hundreds together - and the reason we signed him is because we want him to score hundreds, double-hundreds, help us win games and be successful - it will be interesting to see where it may lead to. 'No one has got any idea whether Kevin Pietersen will play for England again. 'The only people that know that are those who are currently picking the England side. 'At the moment he's not being considered, because he hasn't played red ball cricket for the last 14 months.' Pietersen chills out against the fence as Oxford MCCU bat on Monday . Alec Stewart (right) believes that Pietersen could make it difficult for the England selectors . ______ 'This is not a lad that's going to go away, and the ECB need to make a decision on Kevin Pietersen - make a very public decision on him, whether he is available for selection or not,' he said. 'I know the chairman elect, Colin Graves, has said that he is. 'But it needs to come from the selectors.' Pietersen believes last week's departure of Paul Downton - the ECB managing director who described him as 'disengaged' - has offered him an England 'lifeline' even as he approaches the veteran stage of his record-breaking career. Stewart, who played for England until the age of 40, added: 'Whether you're 18 or 38, if you're good enough, then I believe you take the age factor out of the occasion. 'If you're performing, surely you've got to be warranting a place in the team.' Pietersen made 170 runs off 149 balls during his stint with the bat in Oxford on Sunday . Pietersen fielding on Monday afternoon as the 34-year-old makes his county cricket return . He hopes Pietersen can boost Surrey's championship promotion prospects, and was encouraged by his comeback. 'It was a very good innings,' Stewart added. 'He had to get used to playing red ball cricket again - lining it up, letting it go - and then he showed what a quality batsman he is, which we all know but we just haven't seen it because he's only played 20-over cricket. 'We've signed Kevin because he's a top-class player. 'Will he play for England? We don't know. All we're going to do is enjoy having Kevin around, scoring as many runs as he can. 'Next game, next innings, is the next most important one.' Pietersen had a quieter second day back in his whites. He fielded at mid-off and slip as Surrey's hosts dug in after resuming on 28 for four. Jack McIver top-scored with 83, hitting 11 fours and a six, in the students' 224 all out.

'He could easily go off and get his IPL contract and play over there,' Hussain said on Sky Sports 2. 'He's decided to give it another go... people say 'Oh, 170 against Oxford - it was only Oxford'. 'But as a player who has played 100 Test matches to turn up at The Parks and smash 170 shows how determined he is - so I'd watch out, if I was a selector.'

It perfectly illustrates his work ethic and his obsession with guarding against complacency but even he must know that right now no-one is further from the chop than the 44-year-old coach who took Atletico Madrid to the title last season and leads them into the Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid on Tuesday night. There was a communal sigh let-out across several boardrooms of top European football clubs two weeks ago when he put pen to paper on a new deal that ties him to the club until 2019. Diego Simeone shows off his playing skills as he prepare Atletico Madrid for their Champions League clash . Simeone talks to his squad ahead of Real Madrid's visit on Tuesday night in the quarter final first leg . Sporting directors from Manchester to Milan were watching his situation carefully and the new four year contract with the option of a fifth season appears to have ended his chances of arriving in Italy or England this summer. Back home in Madrid the Atletico supporters were delirious at the news. Never mind that last year’s title will not be repeated this season. The fans have long enough memories to remember how bad things were back in December 2011, before his appointment. ______ Costa had previously been out on loan at Albacete and had the good grace to go into their dressing-room after the game and congratulate his former team-mates on their giantkilling scalp. Back in his own dressing room the mood was bleak. The team were closer to the relegation zone than the European places and Manzano was soon sacked and replaced by Simeone. Sceptics said his inexperience as a coach in Europe would prevent him succeeding. Romantics said the former captain and double winner at Atletico would bring back the glory days. The romantics were right. Without Costa, who was at first loaned out to Rayo Vallecano, Simeone’s Atletico won the Europa League and the European Super Cup. Costa returned to help them win the Copa del Rey and the league as well as making last season’s Champions League final. That final in Lisbon seemed to put Real back on top in the Spanish capital but Simeone’s noisy neighbours have refused to pipe-down. In the six subsequent matches between the two sides they have not let Real win a single game. In the two-legged Spanish Super Cup at the start of the season Atletico drew 1-1 in the Bernabeu and beat Real 1-0 in the Calderon. They then went to the Bernabeu in the league and won 2-1. Saul scores a brilliant bicycle kick during the 4-0 win over Real at the Vicente Calderon earlier this season . Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale were unable to do anything to prevent Atletico's dominance in February . And when the two teams were drawn against each other in the Copa del Rey Atletico won the first leg 2-0 and then drew the second. Worse was to come for Real Madrid in the League in February when they lost the away fixture 4-0. This season Atletico Madrid are not going to win the league but no one is ruling out another tilt at the prize they were seconds from winning last season – leading from Diego Godin’s goal until the last minute when Sergio Ramos scored to take the match to extra time. Atletico players had told anyone who would listen throughout last season that while they didn’t give themselves much of a chance in La Liga up against the stronger squads of Real Madrid and Barcelona, they did fancy themselves in the Champions League – ‘we can beat anyone over two legs’ was the message and that still stands. They showed tremendous resilience to come through against Bayer Leverkusen in the last round with Fernando Torres scoring the last penalty of the shoot-out. Ronaldo scored the fourth goal in Real Madrid's win over their rivals in last year's Champions League final . Simeone's players watch on after losing out in Lisbon, but are determined to bounce back this year . He put through his own net at the weekend in the league typifying that faltering league form and will probably make way for Mario Mandzukic Tuesday. The battering-ram bought from Bayern in the summer to replace Costa has not always met Simeone’s demands for constant pressing of the opposition’s defence this season. After a fall-out with Simone, who in one recent match was visibly furious with his striker, a fragile truce has been called although the likes of PSG’s Edinson Cavani and Villarreal’s Luciano Vietto are being looked at as replacements for next season. Mandzukic told his manager recently that he had regularly played through injury and wanted resting. He was obliged, and now looks set to be brought back in to face Pepe and Sergio Ramos. Former Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic (behind) is set to start alongside Antoine Griezmann . Mandzukic has patched up his relationship with Simeone and will play ahead of Fernando Torres on Tuesday . Tuesday night may well be as much about keeping a clean sheet as scoring. Ronaldo returns the scene of Madrid’s biggest crime this season – that 4-0 defeat in the league on the day he celebrated his 30th birthday. Sometimes in training Simeone likes to play a very special game of attack against defence. He lines up a first team back seven against 14 youth teamers. He’s proud of the first-team defences’ ability to keep the ball out of their goal despite being outnumbered two to one. Whether 14 youth team players amounts to more or less than Gareth Bale, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema is open to debate. But then again those three were all on the pitch back in February for the 4-0 Atletico win and they never got anywhere near a goal. Tuesday night is a chance for Real Madrid to avenge that defeat, but it’ s also another chance for Simeone to show once again that in the Spanish capital he is the boss.","Current Chelsea striker Diego Costa would also remember that period well. He was just about to return from a cruciate ligament injury that had sidelined him for three months. The Argentinian manager has imposed his incredible work ethic on his players since joining Atletico .

But despite receiving plaudits for the quality of their football, which at times appeared to be unplayable, flaws started to appear a month ago when they were held to a goalless draw by Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn in the FA Cup. Brendan Rodgers says his sides recent defeats are down to his players, not his tactics being susses . After scraping a win against Swansea they were then exposed by Manchester United and Arsenal, two teams already in the top four. However, Rodgers insists a drop-off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents. 'I don't think it's about being worked out. We didn't start well (against Arsenal), and it doesn't matter what system you are playing if that happens,' he said. 'In the last four games that we've played we haven't created as much, and that's more on ourselves. Liverpool have lost ground in the race for the Champions League places and will find it hard to recover . 'Of course you give opponents credit but every team will go into a game to defend well and work hard against you. 'Probably the Blackburn game when we drew 0-0 and the games following that we haven't created as much. 'That's something that we want to reinforce - the creativity for chances and hopefully taking those chances. ______ For Rodgers and Liverpool though the cup now represents the only chance to save their season and that should guarantee a reaction at Ewood Park. 'It's important to have a game quickly when you lose,' added Rodgers. 'The group is very committed to winning this trophy but in order to do that you have to qualify and we know Blackburn will be a difficult game for us. Steven Gerrard (left) and Mario Balotelli look on as Rodgers give a talk to his players and staff . 'A trophy this season will mark another step forward for us. Getting to a final and winning a trophy is what we want. 'In terms of the FA Cup that was always an objective. 'On Wednesday, we'll look to reach our second semi-final of the season in the cup competitions (having been narrowly beaten by Chelsea over two legs).' With the play-offs out of reach for Rovers they will also be putting all their efforts into trying to reach a Wembley last-four encounter with Aston Villa. Jordan Rhodes (centre) can cause Liverpool's leaky defence a number of problems in the FA Cup replay . They showed enough on Merseyside a month ago to suggest they can trouble the Reds and, having dispatched top-flight sides Swansea and Stoke at Ewood Park, they will have no fear of Liverpool's arrival. 'Blackburn have got some excellent players. They defended well when they came to Anfield,' said Rodgers. 'We'll go there really focused and determined - we can't wait to play again after the weekend's disappointment.'","'It's a difficult system to play against, but it's one of a number of systems we've played here and played very well. Alexis Sanchez fires home Arsenal's third goal, as the Gunners thrashed Liverpool at the Emirates . 'It's my job to always look to find the solutions, that's what I've tried to do in the games when we didn't look like scoring, finding a way to win.' Blackburn, who host Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, will take heart from the Merseysiders' mini-slump at a crucial time of the season.","Here are my attempts to fill in the blank:

14135,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l3,295,0,2,"Kevin Pietersen has thrown his support behind former team-mate Michael Vaughan as the right man to 'change the brand of cricket currently being played' in England. Ten years on from his career-defining captaincy in the 2005 Ashes, Vaughan is the hot favourite to be appointed as director of England cricket, a streamlined version of the managing director's job which was abolished with Paul Downton's sacking on Wednesday. The 40-year-old has previously kept his distance from a formal role with the ECB, preferring to focus on his burgeoning media profile and business interests, but has declared himself open to discussions about the new post. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen believes Michael Vaughan is the right man to lead England Cricket . Pietersen received the lion's share of attention during a photocall for his new club Surrey . The controversial star and Vaughan were England team-mates before Pietersen was axed by the ECB . Vaughan would be a pioneering presence, having spoken with passion and candour about the need to accept England's failings and press for change at all costs. That may yet prove good news for the exiled Pietersen. The controversial batsman has largely kept his counsel on the demise of Downton, whose first act in the job was to sack Pietersen last February. But he did tell BreatheSport that his 2005 Ashes captain Vaughan had the credentials to replace him. 'He (Vaughan) is close enough to the game to make changes which need to happen for the good of English cricket,' Pietersen said. 'The way he captained shows he'll change the brand of cricket currently being played, which we need.' Vaughan has previously concentrated on his media duties but is believed to be open to the role . The former England captain speaks with Stuart Broad during last summer's Test series with India . Vaughan holds the urn after England famously reclaimed the Ashes against Australia in 2005 . Pietersen may not have played international cricket for well over a year but his shadow looms large over the current turmoil surrounding England. Downton's troubled reign was defined by the decision to martyr Pietersen after the 2013/14 Ashes. The ECB board met at Lord's on Thursday, but there was no official word on the recruitment process. Instead a short statement merely confirmed that Giles Clarke's move from chairman to president had been rubber-stamped, with Middlesex deputy chairman Ian Lovett nominated as vice-chairman. Clarke will become the first ECB president on May 14, a role that carries responsibility for ICC business, while his old post will go to Colin Graves. Graves was the man who gave new legs to Pietersen's mooted comeback when he appeared to suggest a blank slate policy would take root when he arrived at Lord's. Graves hinted that a prolific run in county cricket could see him reinstated, which led to the 34-year-old extricating himself from his Indian Premier League contract and re-signing with Surrey. Downton's exit removed one significant obstacle and should Vaughan be handed the new position, that would strengthen his hand yet further. Former director of England Cricket, Paul Downton, was sacked after the nation's dismal World Cup . Another former England captain Alex Stewart has also put his hat into the ring for the vacancy . ______ Strauss' relations with Pietersen deteriorated badly in his final days as England captain, and an X-rated slip of the tongue during a commentary stint last summer suggested those wounds have not healed. There was no news from the board meeting on the future of national selector James Whitaker, who appeared vulnerable after Downton's dismissal. He looks set to continue in the role for the time being and is due to join the senior side in the West Indies for the second Test in Grenada and third in Barbados.","Surrey chief Alec Stewart, another former England captain who has indicated he would be open to talks with the ECB, is a confirmed Pietersen supporter - but another possible applicant, Andrew Strauss, is unlikely to be as effusive.",WHAT HAS BEEN DECLARED ABOUT JAMES WHITAKER'S FUTURE AT ENGLAND.,0.8105561733,0.8309354782,0.8206193447,0.0833333333,0.0,0.0416666667,0.0416666667

The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. ______ Gary Mabbutt has been left with a 30inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged . He was treated at King's College Hospital in south east London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal it . The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think ""It's never going to happen to me"". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.'

Sergio Perez walks through the paddock in Shanghai ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Perez locks his brakes on his way to 10th place finish in the Australian Grand Prix in March . The hope is Perez and team-mate Nico Hulkenberg will then finally be able to compete for points finishes, rather than crossing fingers a top-10 spot comes their way via reliability issues for their rivals. If performance is lacking, however, Perez fears the worst. 'We're hoping to make a big step forward,' said Perez. 'If we make that step then we can still have a good year as there will be plenty of races remaining, a lot of time to recover. 'But if we don't make the step we're hoping for then it's going to be a very painful year.'

Left on the bench for Wednesday night’s home clash with Kilmarnock, perhaps uncertain over his place in the starting XI for Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness, the Celtic striker scored a 19-minute hat-trick to guide his team to a handsome 4-1 victory. The Treble-chasing reigning champions came from a goal down, inspired by Kris Commons and the second-half introduction of Griffiths, to record a win that takes them eight points clear at the top of the Premiership – and lifts confidence ahead of their trip to Hampden. Hat-trick hero Leigh Griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award . Darryl Westlake’s wickedly deflected strike early in the second half had given the visitors a shock lead completely against the run of play – only for Commons to equalise in spectacular, if contested, fashion eight minutes later. ______ Rightly named Man of the Match despite playing for just over half an hour, the former Hibs front man eased all the frets and fears of home fans on a night that had looked to be slipping away from their team. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick against Kilmarnock . Celtic had begun the night with a starting XI looking very much like the team Deila might have been thinking about for Hampden, all things being equal; leaving Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven, both suspended for the semi-final, on the bench suggested that he was giving his Cup formation a gentle run out. Against a Kilmarnock team whose ambition rarely threatened to over-reach their ability, there were certainly passages of play that resembled nothing so uncompetitive as a training session. With Lee Miller plodding along on his lonesome up front and only the pace of left winger Tope Obadeyi carrying even the hint of a threat to the home side, the visitors – doughty in defence but reliably clumsy on the ball – were obviously intent on playing a containing game. Griffiths collects the match ball after his second-half hat trick on Wednesday night . Maybe, just maybe, they’d catch Celtic sleeping and grab a surprise goal. And, if not, well, a nil-nil at Parkhead is never a disgrace, right? The problem for those who turned up in anticipation of a football match was that, however well Celtic played, attack against defence boasts only so much in the way of entertainment value. James Forrest looked the most obvious outlet for a Celtic breakthrough, the winger scampering down the left and finding space where none should have existed, though too often making the wrong call. The former Scotland regular might have scored himself with seven minutes on the clock, tearing into the box and receiving an Emilio Izaguirre pass at pace, yet Forrest’s first touch was half an ounce heavy – allowing young Killie captain Lee Ashcroft to make a vital block on his shot. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . It didn’t take overly long for the crowd, such as it was on a night when empty seats abounded, to grow frustrated by the home team’s inability to get themselves ahead. Virgil van Dijk loping forward from central defence caused a few stirs of excitement, Stefan Johansen’s running beyond lone striker John Guidetti promised at least a possibility or two. Still space in the final third remained at a premium. Home skipper Scott Brown should have done a great deal better with an Izaguirre cut-back on the half-hour mark, failing to connect cleanly with the bouncing ball and watching it balloon high and wide of the target. Would set-pieces, of which there were an increasing number, provide a more productive avenue of attack for Celtic? Well, big Van Dijk came fairly close with a flashing header from a Commons corner. In open play, an inability – or unwillingness – to let fly continued to be the running theme, one great guddle involving Guidetti and Forrest, neither finding that half yard needed to take a shot inside the box, moving the locals to howls of annoyance. If they were irked by their heroes showing less than perfect concentration in the art of opening up their opposition, Kilmarnock’s opener had the home support in uproar when they took a hugely unexpected lead four minutes into the second half. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) congratulates Griffiths after the final whistle . Two or three Celtic players had a chance to close down and dispossess Obadeyi as he made ground and tied defenders in on the flank, yet he kept hold of the ball long enough for support to arrive in the shape of Westlake. Sure, the midfielder’s shot took the kind of deflection for which there is no accounting, smacking Jason Denayer and spinning beyond a helpless Craig Gordon. But failure to apply due diligence at the back definitely contributed to the concession. Their fans roused and their own pride hurt, Celtic had to muster a quick response. Step forward the captain, who pounced to nick the ball off the toe of Sammy Clingan – prompting immediately complaints of a dangerous challenge. Griffiths was thrown into the fray before the game could be restarted, Forrest making way as Celtic tried to provide Guidetti with more support up front. As substitutions go, not one of Deila’s worst. Griffiths had been on the park all of six minutes, in fact, when he put Celtic ahead, rising to score with a downward header after Commons had shown excellent skill and vision to drive towards the byeline, beat his man and dig out a cross to the back post. As soon as they went ahead, the shackles seemed to fall from the limbs of the home players. Suddenly, they were finding space, making killer passes, creating openings and – most importantly – taking shots. None better than the 25-yarder that Griffiths sent screaming past Craig Samson with 10 minutes remaining, the ball cannoning in off the keeper’s right-hand post. When he was put through behind the defence four minutes later, there was never any doubt about what would happen, the striker finishing low and hard past a shell-shocked Samson.","As good and important as Commons was for Celtic, though, even his performance was overshadowed by the arrival of Griffiths, who simply exploded on to the scene with three goals of supreme quality in less time than it takes for the average warm down.",His place.,0.8734812737,0.809853971,0.8404650688,0.0434782609,0.0,0.0434782609,0.0434782609

This may seem a little premature, but as Eden Hazard prepares for to make his 100th Barclays Premier League appearance for Chelsea at QPR on Sunday, the little magician could have a rival in years to come. Hazard is some player, one of the elite in English football with those dazzling runs and the sparkling feet that can open up the best defences in the league. Eden Hazard has developed into one of the world's best players after flourishing at Chelsea . Hazard has proven himself as a goalscorer and a creator of chances during his time with Chelsea . Hazard celebrates scoring against Hull earlier this season as Chelsea march towards the Premier League title . This season he has been imperious, full of movement and flexibility as Chelsea close in on a double of Capital One Cup and Premier League in Jose Mourinho's second season back at Stamford Bridge. After Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in February at the Parc des Princes, Mourinho demanded more protection from referees for Hazard. Chelsea's dancing winger is a marked man. The PFA young player of the year had been fouled nine times, with Laurent Blanc's team taking it in turns to nobble the Chelsea No 10 in the first leg of their Champions League second round tie. He has scored some special goals, 17 so far with another nine assists, as Mourinho's team close in on a fourth Premier League title in the Abramovich era. On Sunday, April 26 the PFA players' player of the year award could be his, joining a list of winners that includes Luis Suarez, Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry and his Chelsea team-mate John Terry in recent times. He has grown to love English football, adapting to the demands of the Premier League and the numerous managers he has already played for since his move from Lille in 2012. Roberto Di Matteo was still Chelsea's manager when Hazard tweeted that he was joining 'this season's Champions League winner' ahead of his £32million move from France. He made an impressive start in the Premier League, assisting the opening goal for Chelsea in the 2-0 victory at Wigan and winning the penalty for Frank Lampard to convert at the DW Stadium. Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille for £32million in 2012 after the Blues beat a host to clubs to his signature . Hazard was involved in a controversial incident at Swansea when he kicked the ball as it lay under the ball boy . Hazard was sent off after the ball-boy incident as Chelsea were beaten in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Hazard, his wife Natasha and their kids enjoy some off time at Disneyland Paris . Di Matteo loved him as a player and he went through a notable dip in form when the European Cup-winning coach was fired after the 4-1 defeat against Juventus in the Champions League. A few months later he was sent off when he infamously wrestled with a ball-boy during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final defeat against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. He finished the season with a Europa League medal after Chelsea's victory over Benfica the Amsterdam ArenA, but it is the arrival of Mourinho that has transformed his game. Last season there was a period of frustration among Chelsea's first team players because they shared the view of the coach that they had signed a world class talent. Despite his ability he was often one of the first to leave after training, heading home to his family - wife Natasha and their two young children, after a quick shower and lunch with his team-mates. Slowly he has bought into dressing room culture. There is a ruthless streak about him these days and Mourinho, to his credit, drew it out of him after meeting Hazard's father, along with his lawyer, after Belgium's disappointing World Cup in Brazil. Hazard has grown in stature since he was handed Juan Mata's old No 10 shirt, requesting the jersey after the winger left for Manchester United in January 2014. The No 10 shirt is also the number of his hero Zinedine Zidane, the player a young Hazard idolised when he was making his way through Belgian football before his move to Lille. In recent times he has been encouraged to drift across the front three positions, interchanging with Oscar (in the centre) and Willian (on the right) when it takes his fancy. Hazard helped Chelsea win the Europa League under Rafa Benitez when they beat Benfica in the final . Hazard, pictured alongside Luis Suarez, was named the PFA Young Player of the Year last season . Hazard added a second trophy to his Chelsea collection this season when the Blues won the Capital One Cup . ______ He is the focal point of Chelsea's attack, a willing outlet with a first touch that you can melt when he takes it on the instep of his right boot. He has been scoring goals again, adding to his tally this season in recent weeks with strikes for club and country as the season hurtles towards the finish line. At 24 he is maturing nicely, a humble man who impressed Chelsea's hierarchy during the complex negotiations over a new contract towards the end of last year. He has never been responsible for the glut of stories linking him with a move back to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain and he consistently told the club that he was willing to remain at Stamford Bridge. Hazard's contract talks were reminiscent of Gary Neville at Manchester United, leaving it with the club to determine the terms on his new five-year contract. Chelsea settled on £200,000 a week. To those who know him, he speaks of trophies and a hunger to be remembered as a player who contributed to one of the most successful periods in Chelsea's history.

6007,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l3,126,0,0,"Kevin Pietersen has hinted the first chapter of his county comeback could be streamed live to fans. The divisive batsman has re-signed for Surrey this summer in an attempt to win an unlikely England recall, having been thrown an apparent lifeline by incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves. He has not played in the LV= County Championship since 2013 but is set to start the season with the Brown Caps in the hope of turning the selectors' heads and reversing last year's controversial sacking. Kevin Pietersen will step up his attempts to earn an England recall when he starts batting on Monday . The 34-year-old Pietersen wants to end his England absence that started after the 2013-14 Ashes whitewash . Pietersen (right) rejoined Surrey  after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves said domestic form would help . The 34-year-old has indicated that his campaign will start with a three-day warm-up against Oxford MCCU on April 12 and he is due to return to the nets on Monday. Pietersen announced that to his 2.3 million Twitter followers on Easter Sunday, raising the prospect of using the social network's new broadcast app, Periscope, to showcase his session in real time. He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. Should I? #comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's '#comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. He clearly feels Graves' words are encouragement enough of a Test recall but after so many bitter recriminations - and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography - there are still many bridges to build. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge both selectorial and public opinion from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed. ______ Coach Peter Moores was less ambiguous. Moores was sacked from his first stint in charge in 2008, partially at the behest of Pietersen, whose intervention also cost him the captaincy. Incoming ECB chairman Graves advised that signing for a domestic side would help Pietersen's cause . Alastair Cook (left) was coy on Pietersen's chances of a recall but Peter Moores said he 'isn't on the radar' Moores was previously dismissed as England coach at the behest of Pietersen when he was captain . He was then belittled as a nagging 'woodpecker' in the the batsman's memoir and reconciliation between the two men would appear a stretch. Asked at Gatwick about the situation, Moores said: 'From my point of view, Kevin isn't on the radar.' He would, therefore, seem an unlikely viewer of Pietersen's Periscope net session.","Captain Alastair Cook, who was not given a glittering write-up in the Pietersen's book, largely absolved himself from the decision-making process, insisting it would be taken by Graves, managing director of England cricket Paul Downton and chief executive Tom Harrison.",The unlikely milestone daring Braith Antrim to display himself as an TV personality.,0.8359085321,0.7968468666,0.8159104586,0.0714285714,0.0,0.0714285714,0.0714285714

Watford temporarily moved top by beating Middlesbrough, who started the day as leaders, in the lunch-time kick-off and Norwich then went above them with victory against Sheffield Wednesday. But Bournemouth have been this season’s pacesetters and clearly have no intention of stepping aside for the final sprint to the finish line. It did not feel like that, however, when the visitors stunned them with two goals in three minutes. A straightforward ball was played over the top from central midfield by Andrew Shinnie, on 18 minutes, and Clayton Donaldson burst through on goal. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc started to come from his line then hesitated and before he knew it the striker had sent the ball over him and in. ‘We want eight,’ the travelling Birmingham supporters chanted in jest, demanding vengeance for Bournemouth thrashing them 8-0 in the reverse of this fixture back in October. That scoreline became less fantastical when they added a second in the 21st minute. Birmingham winger David Cotterill made a strong run down the right and with a defender backing off he buried a strike across goal into the bottom left corner. ‘That didn’t feel too good,’ Howe admitted. ‘I’d be lying if I said nerves won’ t come into it, it’s only natural considering what’s at stake.’ But Bournemouth have not got around the automatic qualification places by buckling under pressure and they scored twice before the break. Callum Wilson rounds Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph to draw Bournemouth level . Wilson celebrates his 17th league goal of the season as Bournemouth fight back from two goals down . Steve Cook (centre) battles past a host of Birmingham defenders to score for Bournemouth and make it 2-1 . On 39 minutes, Matt Ritchie whipped in a corner from the right-hand side and Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook both leapt for it, the latter eventually bundling the ball over the line. Then in first-half stoppage time Yann Kermorgant played a delicate ball through Birmingham’s defence, perfectly weighted between defender and goalkeeper for Callum Wilson to round Darren Randolph and tap in. Only three minutes into the second half and they were in front. Wilson broke free down the right, carried the ball into the box and was scythed down by Birmingham defender Paul Robinson after a cheeky turn. Kermogant stoked in the penalty. ‘I felt the officials were inconsistent,’ Birmingham manager Gary Rowett said. 'We had three clear onsides given off and Wilson was level when he won the penalty. Elphick tried to slap Rob Kiernan in a melee at the end and the referee was right next to it but gave nothing.’ If Birmingham’s two goals in three minutes were impressive, Bournemouth’s three in nine were even more devastating and they added to that in the 74th minute. Substitute Adam Smith first had a shot from the edge of the box blocked, which left Randolph on the floor, and the midfielder went for the opposite corner only for the keeper to dive back. But there was nothing Randolph could do when the ball came out to Charlie Daniels who struck a shot into the ground which looped in off the bar.

ISIS released the video, believed to have been filmed last month, showing militants smashing artifacts in the historic city, which is on UNESCO's tentative list of world heritage sites, before blowing it up . The attack on the ancient site horrified archaeologists when it was first reported last month, and has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The seven-minute video, posted late Saturday, shows bearded militants using sledgehammers, jackhammers and saws to take down huge alabaster reliefs depicting Assyrian kings and deities. A bulldozer brings down walls, while militants fill barrels with explosives and later destroy three separate areas of the site in massive explosions. 'God has honored us in the Islamic State to remove all of these idols and statutes worshipped instead of Allah in the past days,' one militant says in the video. Another militant vows that 'whenever we seize a piece of land, we will remove signs of idolatry and spread monotheism.' Attack: The video, made available by a Jihadist media outlet, shows ISIS militants destroying a stoneslab with a sledgehammer at what they say is the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq . Horrified: The attack on the ancient site has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . Islamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, daying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law . ______ There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely.' 'In a new crime in their series of reckless offenses they assaulted the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy machinery, appropriating archaeological attractions dating back 13 centuries BC,' the United Nations cultural agency UNESCO said in a statement last month. UNESCO head Irina Bokova added: 'This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing under way in the country: it targets human lives, minorities, and is marked by the systematic destruction of humanity's ancient heritage,' she said . Complete destruction: The end of the video allegedly shows Islamic State militants blowing up the ancient ruins near Mosul . One of many: This is only the most recent video purporting to show Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites . Islamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, saying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law, including the ancient Iraqi city of Hatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Authorities also believe they've sold others on the black market to fund their atrocities. This is only the most recent proof of Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites. A shocking video emerged last week, showing ISIS militants using sledgehammers and AK-47 rifles to destroy walls and statues in Iraq's UNESCO World Heritage city of Hatra. In the slickly produced seven minute footage, jihadists are shown smashing shrines and statues in the 2,000-year old city. Militants are also recorded chipping away at the bases of some of the larger wall sculptures and cracking boulders into ancient city pillars, while eerie music plays in the background. The video cuts to jihadists speaking directly to the camera with one declaring they destroyed the site because it is 'worshipped instead of God'. Last month, ISIS terrorists were pictured toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. The Assyrians first rose around 2,500 B.C. and at one point ruled over a realm stretching from the Mediterranean coast to what is present-day Iran. They left dozens of palaces and temples decorated with huge reliefs mainly depicting their kings' military campaigns and conquests, hunting lions and making sacrifices to the gods. Their main hallmark was the colossal winged man-headed lions or bulls, protective deities put at the entrances of palaces and temples weighing about 10-30 tons each, some of which are now at the British Museum. Located on the eastern side of the Tigris River, Nimrud was founded in the 13th century B.C. During the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud served as the second capital for Assyrian Empire. Other Assyrian capitals were Ashur, Dur Sharrukin and Ninevah. Nimrud and some of its kings were mentioned in the Bible, the city mentioned under the name of Calah or Kalhu in the Book of Genesis. Excavations at Nimrud were first started by the British traveler and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard from 1845 to 1851, followed by other foreign and local excavation missions. The city is surrounded by a four-side wall measuring 8 kilometers (5 miles) long. Among the ruins are the grand palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as the temples of Nabu, the god of writing and the arts, and other temples. Among the most significant discoveries at Nimrud were four tombs of royal women. There, a collection of 613 pieces of gold jewelry and precious stones were unearthed. They survived the looting of the Iraqi National Museum that followed the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 as they were kept in a vault at the Central Bank of Iraq building by Saddam Hussein's government.","It is believed parts of the footage may be from a nearby site as some of the figures in the Nimrud video appears to have rebar, ribbed steel bars designed to reinforce concrete that are a technique of modern building. However, an Iraqi Antiquities Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all the items at Nimrud were authentic. When the destruction was first reported several weeks ago a Mosul tribal leader confirmed that SIIS had 'looted the valuables in Nimrud and then proceeded to level the site to the ground.","The city destroyed by Islamic State militants is called which ancient city mentioned in the article, was founded around 2,500 years old according to the text.

Not only that, the former Manchester United great has scored 99 goals under manager Carlo Ancelotti in just 89 games, following his five against Granada three days ago. His latest puts the 30-year-old  just seven goals behind Di Stefano's record of 307 in 396 outings, and 23 shy of Raul's 323 in 741 — with plenty of time to surpass both Bernabeu legends. Up until his opening goal 22 minutes from time, however, it long looked like Ancelotti would be left as deflated as the balloons that Ronaldo took a disliking to in the first half. Ronaldo had given four orange balloons that invaded the pitch at the Campo de Futbol de Vallecas a kicking as his team failed to dominate against a team with little left to play for in mid-table. Rayo in no way had their flip flops on, and fancied giving the winners of La Decima a run for their money. They did just that, proving far more difficult than the Granada side beaten 9-1 on Sunday. Yet Real's rotten luck was epitomised by Ronaldo's yellow card  in the 52nd minute, received for diving inside the 18-yard box with the game at 0-0. He had beaten the offside trap, before cutting inside to shoot, only for defender Antonio Amaya to chop him down. Quite clearly, too. Replays were not needed to show it was a wrong decision from referee Mario Melero Lopez to book Ronaldo for diving. From every angle, there was no question it should have been a penalty, and Ancelotti will appeal the caution in a bid to have his one-game ban rescinded. 'I told the referee that everyone saw it was a penalty,' Ancelotti said afterwards. 'I told him it was incredible that he didn't award a penalty and that he showed Cristiano the yellow card. We will appeal.' The booking lit something in the stomachs of the Madrid players, as Toni Kroos, Bale and Dani Carvajal were cautioned for dissent less than three minutes later before they broke the deadlock soon after.

On 68 minutes,  Carvajal got his own back. The Spain right-back escaped his marker down the  wing before crossing for Ronaldo to head home his 300th goal for Los Blancos. An easy way to reach a milestone. Ronaldo, in celebration, gestured towards the linesman who robbed him of the penalty and, from then on, the win never looked in doubt. It was James Rodriguez who put daylight between the teams just five minutes later. The Colombia international's controlled shot found the bottom-left corner, and effectively killed the game off to ensure Madrid would not be left six points adrift of Barcelona. Ancelotti added: 'We tried to pressure them with more intensity high up the pitch but in the first half we were not convincing. In the second, we were more complete, we played well and we deserved to win.' They will have to repeat the trick  on Saturday against Eibar to remain within touching distance of Barcelona, but are set to be without the suspended Ronaldo.

In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder.

Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost £12,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. ______ To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree . Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow.

Harlequins winger Charlie Walker crosses for his side's first try at the Stoop . ‘We’ve had a difficult year, but anyone who has watched him will know he’s been absolutely outstanding. When we get back to winning he will get recognition again,’ O'Shea said. Quins spent most of an uninspiring mid-table clash feeding off scraps due to the overwhelming superiority of the visiting scrum, only to produce the key drive in the 70th minute that was finished by Marland Yarde. As half time drew close, referee Luke Pearce had finally lost patience with Harlequins set-piece frailty and pointed the finger at Joe Marler by sending the club captain to the sin-bin. Gloucester only entered the interval 13-11 ahead - a poor return given their ascendency - and then moved 18-11 clear through a Charlie Sharples try with half an hour remaining to suggest their eighth win of the season was imminent. Quins centre Aseli Tikoirotuma puts in a strong fend on Gloucester lock James Hudson . The kicking of Nick Evans kept Quins in touch - the Kiwi fly-half finished with 14 points - before an eventful final quarter produced a flurry of yellow cards and three tries. Yarde seized the initiative for the London club and full-back Ollie Lindsay-Hague appeared to have sealed the victory, only for Dan Robson's try with a minute left to give Gloucester a faint glimmer of hope until they aimlessly kicked the ball away in the last act of the game. The opening 10 minutes were dominated by Gloucester's scrum, yet it was Quins who opened the scoring when outside centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma jinked into space before sending Charlie Walker over. Walker's try was the result of a clinical counter attack, but the 2012 Premiership champions were immediately back under pressure once play resumed with their set-piece targeted once more, conceding a penalty that Greig Laidlaw sent between the uprights. Gloucester No 8 Gareth Evans is hit hard by Quins flanker Jack Clifford . Laidlaw and Evans exchanged penalties and just as Quins began to attack with greater frequency, yet another retreating scrum gave Gloucester the platform to race into a 31st minute lead. Hook broke the gainline with a large dummy - his second of the afternoon - and found Bill Meakes in support, with the outside centre showing strength to force his way over from 10 yards out. Gloucester's set-piece dominance was rewarded when Pearce sent Marler to the sin bin, but they were unable to turn a push late in the first half into points. A big step and outside-break from full-back Lindsay-Hague created a half-chance for Yarde moments after the interval, but the England wing was well tackled. Harry Sloan tries to evade the clutches of Cherry and Whites flanker Sione Kalamafoni . It was then Gloucester's turn to find space through Jonny May down the right wing only for Sharples to drop what should have been a try scoring pass. Two attacking scrums later, however, and Sharples dived over after Meakes had spotted the overlap caused by Quins being sucked into the one-sided forward exchanges. Evans' boot whittled down the deficit to one point but as the match entered the final quarter number eight Jack Clifford was shown a yellow card for a shoulder challenge on Sharples and Laidlaw rifled over the ensuing penalty. Gloucester scrum half Dan Robson crosses the Quins whitewash for a late score . Despite being a man down, Quins almost scored with two successive rolling mauls and on both occasions Gloucester saw a player sin-binned - replacement lock Ross Moriarty for bringing down the first drive and Sharples for a deliberate knock on. On the third line-out catch and drive they succeeded, with Yarde touching down as the game entered the final 10 minutes.

In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . ______ Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up.

The Irons looked to have done enough to battle to victory after taking an early lead through a superb free-kick by full back Aaron Cresswell. However, after seeing two efforts from Marko Arnautovic ruled out for offside and a header by substitute Mame Diouf hit the post, the visitors snatched a deserved point five minutes into stoppage time when the Austrian winger crashed the ball into the far corner. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce was left disappointed after seeing his concede late on against Stoke . Allardyce will be scratching his head as to how he can help his side hang on to slender leads . West Ham remain in top 10 despite their late slip-up . West Ham remain in the top 10, but Allardyce knows their position should have been much more comfortable after witnessing yet another late capitulation from a positive position. 'You have to give Stoke a bit of credit, but from our point of view, we did not play as well as we can,' said Allardyce, who revealed striker Diafra Sakho is set for a spell on the sidelines with a thigh injury. 'It was not about us playing well or not, it was about winning and we had got ourselves into a fantastic position . 'When you are less than 30 seconds away from winning the game and you don't, that is the ultimate blow. 'We are very nervous on that stage based on what happened before. ______ Allardyce added: 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. 'Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' Allardyce is out of contract in the summer, with the club's owners yet to decide in which direction they want to take West Ham ahead of their move to the Olympic Stadium. The 60-year-old, though, intends to remain professional in his approach over the final matches of a campaign which had earlier promised so much. 'It depends on what you say. Do you say what is the overall season like? It should be 50 points, it should be very, very good. It is small margins of victories to draws and draws to defeat,' Allardyce added. 'In the judgement at the end of the season, or if not what happens before that, then we talk about what we are doing going forwards. 'We are still on course to beat the best points record we have had, but we are making it hugely difficult for ourselves now when we really should be coasting instead of looking forward to every game we are playing.' Allardyce has revealed star striker Diafra Sakho is expected to be out for an estimated two to three weeks . Senegal forward Sakho limped off in the second half, and if the problem proves serious, he might not recover before the end of the campaign. Allardyce said: 'If it is a grade one off the scan, then it could be two to three weeks, if it is more, then you would be lucky to see him again this season, which is a massive blow but we have to deal with it.' Stoke boss Mark Hughes felt his side had done more than enough to end a run of three straight defeats. 'We are thankful for small mercies, because we did not think we were going to get what we deserved,' he said. 'I thought we totally dominated the game and should have won it by a country mile. 'We had the setback from the great free-kick early in the game, and it is difficult when you are the away side to come back. 'We showed great resilience and stuck at it, trying to create things, but just lacked that bit of quality at the top end. 'If one of our disallowed goals had counted, I think we would still have had time to go on and win the game. 'We want to better last season's total and are determined now to get something out of all of the matches we have left.'","'We should be on 50 points now, we have thrown away seven points in two minutes or less over four games.

She might not have enjoyed their fame or their financial success. At the peak of her career as an England netball player who won bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games and World Cup, she earned just £742 a month. But there has been no shortage of ambition and no lack of personality. ______ Tracey Neville, pictured at Hotel Football in Manchester, is Phil Neville's twin and sister to Gary Neville . Neville gives a team talk to her Manchester Thunder players during a match with Surrey Storm last year . England coach and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville poses with his sister Tracey and her friends . It might explain why it is Tracey who has risen to the rank of national head coach first, taking England's netball team to this summer's World Cup in Australia while her brothers continue to combine coaching and broadcasting. Gary has spent the past three years as assistant to England manager Roy Hodgson. Tracey was parachuted into the top job on an interim basis last month and will select a squad of 12 for the tournament in August. Winning it will be no easy task, even if England are ranked third in the world. They failed to win a medal in last year's Commonwealth Games and poor results in a recent Test series convinced netball chiefs to turn to 38-year-old Neville, who has performed impressively as the boss at Manchester Thunder. How England perform will impact on funding with up to £4million at stake. The pressure is on. She revived an ageing Thunder team with an injection of youth and has secured two Superleague titles in three years. They are top of the league and later this month will contest their Superleague semi-final at the Manchester Arena, with some suggesting there are echoes of a certain local football team. Like Gary and Phil, she was first capped for her country at 19, eventually making 81 international appearances before a knee injury forced her to retire — and she says her personality is probably a mixture of the brothers'. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter, Matt Lawton, interviews Neville over breakfast at Hotel Football . Phil Neville, who now works as pundit with BT Sport and the BBC, takes a selfie with his twin sister . Neville celebrates with her Manchester Thunder team after clinching the Superleague title in April last year . 'I think we're all natural leaders,' she says as she tucks into a cooked breakfast at Hotel Football, which stands next to Old Trafford and counts her brothers and Manchester United's other 'Class of 92' players among its main investors. 'I'd say I'm quite intense, like Gary. He and I would clash quite a lot. Not to the detriment of our relationship. We're very close. But Philip would be the mediator.' So Phil's the nice one? 'I think I am,' she says, chuckling again. 'I'm probably not as intense as Gary and I'm not the mediator that Philip is. I'm somewhere in the middle. I have bits of both personality traits. 'But I can definitely hold my own with the two of them. I'm probably the one who winds Gary up, to be honest. Being a girl I probably know how to push his buttons.' She says she was never dazzled by the success her brothers enjoyed at United or by the fact that Gary's best mate was David Beckham. 'I knew them all when they were earning £29.50 a week in digs,' she says. And she claims never to have been the sister her brothers turned to for fashion or girlfriend advice. 'We never had those kind of conversations,' she says. 'And Gary and clothes? I don't think they are ever in the same conversation really (cue more laughter). Neville, who will manage England at the netball World Cup, believes she is a natural leader like her brothers . Gary Neville (left) leads Wayne Rooney, James Milner and Michael Carrick (L-R) in England training . Neville represents England at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur aged just 21 . 'But we have an awesome dynamic. We obviously all have a competitive edge but not to the detriment of each other. As kids we were like a pack of cubs. We always looked after our own and that's still the case today. We rely on that support system.' Even as kids, her brothers treated her as an equal. 'I was never a girl they put in the field when we played cricket or in goal when we played football,' she says. 'I was always pretty good at all sports and I would give it my all. 'I would have been a good footballer. I loved playing. My mum was the footballer in the family. She played as a striker. That didn't rub off because like Gary and Phil I was a defender. In the end the big decision I had to make was between hockey and netball. I'd made some good friends in netball so that was the option I took.' Understandably, there is what she describes as 'a certain connection' with Phil. 'We probably speak more,' she says. 'Because Gary's so busy I would see more of his family, his kids, than I do him. 'He never talks about himself. He won the award last week (best sports presenter at the RTS Awards) and nobody in the family even knew he was up for it. He wouldn't say he wants to be the next England manager because his focus will be on the job he's doing at the moment. And when I told Gary I'd got this job, it was just a one-word text response. 'Brilliant,' he said. There was more from Philip. 'Unbelievable. So proud.' I think he tweeted something. That's the difference.' Before Australia she will draw on the experience of both brothers. Phil spent a season as assistant coach to David Moyes at Manchester United. Given the opportunity she would also like to pick the brains of Sir Alex Ferguson. Neville would love to have a coffee with Sir Alex Ferguson and pick his brains before the netball World Cup . Phil Neville spent last season on the coaching staff at Manchester United, with 10 months under David Moyes . Neville has worked in hospitality and earned a maths degree in Bristol and sports science degree in Chester . 'If he wouldn't mind having a coffee with me I'd love to do that,' she says. 'But I've got 30 minutes booked in with Gary. 'There are certain challenges in our sport. It's difficult for the girls to be full-time, and often their jobs become more important because there isn't the financial support. 'I had some difficult financial times as a player. I had great support from my family but I had to take different jobs to support myself. 'I worked in hospitality and got into coaching education and I studied too. I got a maths degree in Bristol before studying for a sports science degree in Chester. These days I'm working with girls who are doctors, lawyers, zoologists. 'But I think I'm a better coach than I ever was a player. One of my strengths is the integration of young players and the way I build a team around a certain ethos. I also have a good understanding of the game.' The challenge is nevertheless significant, as Australia and New Zealand are the powerhouses in netball. 'The Sport England target is to get to the final but we've never made a final before,' she says. 'Last year we finished fourth in the Commonwealths. The team didn't perform to their best so it's my job to get them doing that. 'Ideally I'd like to have had longer to prepare. In a perfect world you'd get a four-year cycle. 'Right now the future beyond the World Cup is uncertain. We'll just have to see how it goes. But I had to take this opportunity. I've always had such passion for England.'

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari's success was 'a wake-up call' to his organisation. Without doubt Mercedes, and Hamilton in particular, responded as he initially finished 0.541 seconds quicker than team-mate Nico Rosberg at the end of FP1 when Pirelli's medium-compound tyre was used. Switching to the faster soft tyre for runs in FP2, Hamilton again comfortably had the edge by 0.443secs over Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest, 1.093secs adrift, but only after taking to the track 40 minutes late due to issues. It is yet to be determined whether they were the same problems that ultimately brought an end to team-mate Daniil Kvyat's day. As the young Russian exited the pits with 20 minutes remaining his brakes caught fire, and although Kvyat attempted to return, he was eventually forced to pull off track. Felipe Massa trudges off the track after his spin brought out the red flags during the second practice session . The Brazilian inspects his Williams after he locked up on the approach to turn 14 before losing the back end . Vettel was fourth on the timesheet, 1.120secs down, with Rosberg fifth after making a mistake on his fast lap on the soft tyres. Kvyat still ended up sixth, followed by the Williams of Valtteri Bottas, Sauber's Felipe Nasr and Romain Grosjean in his Lotus. McLaren's Jenson Button completed the top 10, two seconds down as he and the team continue to show signs of improvement, with team-mate Fernando Alonso 12th and a further half a second off the pace. Felipe Massa's session, meanwhile, lasted 38 minutes as the Williams driver skidded off the track at the end of the longest straight in F1. Daniil Kvyat's brakes caught fire when he left the pits and the Red Bull driver ended up in the gravel . Fernando Alonso looks on from the back of the McLaren garage... he ended the second session in 12th . The Brazilian locked up on the approach to turn 14, losing the back end of the car and resulting in a slide on to the run-off area where he lost the left front-wing endplate after clipping a barrier. Although Massa managed to keep the engine running and reversed his car, the endplate lodged under the left-front tyre, forcing him to abandon. It resulted in the session being red-flagged for the car's retrieval, with Massa ultimately finishing down in 17th. Manor duo Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens brought up the rear, the latter encountering issues with his power unit in FP2 which restricted him to just six laps. Stevens will be hoping the problem can be resolved as he has already missed qualifying and the race in both Australia and Malaysia due to other difficulties.

Liverpool’s manager had already gone cold on the Italian, concluding some time ago that he has no future at Anfield. Rodgers will admit he ignored the warnings about Balotelli. He knew Jose Mourinho considered him ‘unmanageable’ and he listened to the anecdotal evidence he received from the members of his staff who had encountered the troublesome striker during their time at Manchester City. But Rodgers rather hoped Balotelli might be maturing with age, and he made the mistake of thinking he could succeed where others had failed in actually getting through to him. Mario Balotelli has no future at Liverpool after manager Brendan Rodgers lost patience with the striker . Rodgers will admit he ignored the warning signs but had hoped Balotelli was maturing as he got older . Balotelli shared an image of a thermometer reading to prove he was too ill to play against Blackburn . Liverpool’s manager was desperate too, of course. Attempts to recruit other strikers, in particular Alexis Sanchez, had proved unsuccessful last summer and he was concerned that Rickie Lambert would not provide ample cover in a Champions League season if Daniel Sturridge suffered further injury problems. He was right to worry about Sturridge’s physical fragility but wrong, he would probably now concede, to spend £16million on Balotelli. For three hours in his office at Melwood he attempted to lessen the risk before asking his employers to part with the money. He spoke both to Balotelli and his agent, explaining what was expected of every Liverpool player and sharing his philosophy on the power of the collective. Over the years his C.O.R.E principles speech – Commitment. Ownership. Responsibilities. Excellence – had worked with players. He would use a flip-chart to deliver his lecture on the standards he demands and, for the most part, players had responded accordingly. But not Balotelli. Not the player who already had a reputation for having no respect for authority, for his considerable talent or for the clubs he represents. ______ Stoke (H) Won 1-0, November 29, 2014 Reason: Hamstring and groin injuries .

Rodgers is saddened by the fact that Balotelli appears to have no respect for Liverpool, and no apparent willingness to even follow the simplest instructions. In Sturridge’s absence Rodgers told Balotelli he needed a striker who would ‘press’ at the point of Liverpool’s attack; who would play high up the field and in so doing set the pattern of Liverpool’s play. Balotelli, much to his manager’s frustration, just wouldn’t do it, in the misguided belief that he knew better. On the training field there have been similar issues; a situation that has offended team-mates who do buy into Rodgers’ methods and want to build on the success they enjoyed last season. So there will be no second chance for Balotelli at Liverpool next season; no opportunity to redeem himself. Rodgers is continuing to use him when absolutely necessary but he is at the very top of a list of players he will be putting up for sale this summer. He has to get him out and put what money he can recover for him to better use, if only to improve morale in a dressing room that probably lost patience with the guy before even he did.

'In the first-half, we were dreadful. I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not closing people down, not working hard enough and I think I was wrong. 'We were second-best in every department, certainly the midfield areas and the front three. 'But what I will say is with a makeshift back four, they stuck by their guns, along with the goalkeeper, and actually kept us in the game because without those guys, we would have been in big trouble. 'If we'd have got to half-time at 0-0, I actually would have been doing somersaults in the dressing room. That's how poor we were.'

The victory over Newcastle moved Sunderland three points clear of the Premier League relegation zone . Defoe's superb volley in first-half stoppage time won the day for the Black Cats, who remained outside the relegation zone only by virtue of goal difference after Burnley's goalless draw with Tottenham earlier in the day. Defoe blasted the ball past stranded keeper Tim Krul after Steven Fletcher had headed down keeper Costel Pantilimon's long free-kick, but while Dick Advocaat's men enjoyed the better of the game throughout, they were unable to extend their lead. They had to endure a tense conclusion during which Newcastle striker Ayoze Perez volleyed over from close range.

Known as much for his racy - often pornographic - photo shoots as he is for the sexual assault allegations that have been made against him. And this week he faced accusations from the model Kate Upton that he had released footage of her dancing in a bikini without her permission. Scroll down for video . In a new interview with Vogue Kate Upton has revealed that the photographer Terry Richardson released footage of her dancing in a bikini in a video called 'Cat Daddy' without her permission . In an excerpt from an interview Kate did with Vogue in June 2014, it was claimed that Kate was not happy with Terry for releasing the 'Cat Daddy' footage which has been viewed more than 22 million times. In the one-minute-long film, which played a huge part in Kate's rise to fame, and which was uploaded to YouTube two years ago, Kate is seen dancing seductively in a tiny red string bikini - the model says the film was not meant to be for public consumption. Alexa Chung writes in Vogue: 'Terry Richardson found himself on the receiving end of her wrath in May 2012, when he uploaded his now infamous video of Upton in a teeny-weeny bikini doing the Cat Daddy, a dance craze that appears to involve a lot of grinding, ""paws"" aloft. 'The video received millions of hits on YouTube - not to mention a number of slow-motion versions for the more discerning customer - but, at the time, Upton was horrified because the behind-the-scenes video had been filmed for fun, not something she expected would make the final cut.' Terry has worked with Miley Cyrus (left) and Kim Kardashian (right) shooting them in his New York studio . Terry sat front row at the Alexander Wang fashion show in September 2013 alongside Kanye West . When asked about the situation Kate said: 'I was like, ""That was disrespectful, you could have told me!''.' But Upton also adds that there's no bad blood over the YouTube video anymore. 'Now, obviously, it's fine.' However this is not the first time that the 49-year-old photographer who has shot everyone from Miley Cyrus to Kim Kardashian in his New York studio has faced controversy. In fact, to say Richarson's reputation precedes him would be an understatement. He is the man who the Guardian once referred to as 'fashion's shameful secret'. Known to many as 'Uncle Terry,' one of his more controversial shots includes a woman giving a man - thought to be Terry - fellatio whilst he is dressed as a horse. Further sexual shots show Richardson completely nude dressed as the devil and with models who are sexually stimulating him with their hands or mouths. Terry is a regular on the red carpet at some of the biggest event sin the world, he is pictured here heading into the Vanity Fair Oscar's party . Indeed it's been more than ten years since Terry first hit the headlines for his questionable behaviour. In 2004 an intern named 'Alex' was photographed performing oral sex on the photographer while wearing a tiara labelled 'slut', something which the Terry described at the time as, 'It's Sesame Street!' Then in 2009, a model called Sena Cech claimed that Terry's assistant had asked her to give him a handjob, apparently telling her: 'Sena, can you grab his c*** and twist it real hard? He likes it when you squeeze it real hard and twist it.' In 2010 a model named Rie Rasmussen confronted Terry at a party in Paris after he placed pictures of her next to underage models in his book - in America, models under the age of 18 are considered underage. She said: 'He takes girls who are young, manipulates them to take their clothes off and takes pictures of them they will be ashamed of. 'They are too afraid to say no because their agency booked them on the job and are too young to stand up for themselves.' Terry poses with Pharrell Williams (left) and James Franco (right) doing his signature thumbs up pose . ______ he said, in that psychotically upbeat way that temporarily convinces so many girls that what's fun for Uncle Terry is fun for them.' She refers to the fact that Terry wanted to make 'Tampon tea,' with her used sanitary product. Jamie revealed that she also sexually stimulated the photographer with her hand and was encouraged to do so not only by Terry but by his team after he took all of his clothes off. Terry once told the Observer of his shoots: 'A lot of it starts with me saying to a girl, ""Do you want to do nudes?"" And they're like, ""I don't want to be naked"". 'So I say, ""I'll be naked and you take the pictures. You can have the camera. You can have the phallus"".' Despite the allegations which have been levied against him Terry remains popular within the fashion industry pictured here with Ralph Lauren and Emmanuelle Alt . Last year model Sara Ziff spoke to Huffington Post Live about working with Terry and said: 'You are going to a casting to possibly shoot with him for Harper's Bazaar, whose one of his clients. 'That's a legitimate job, and he will ask you to take your clothes off for the casting and in some cases give him sexual favors. 'I have spoken with other models who have been in these situations, and he makes you feel like you're being a prude or you are somehow weird if you are not willing to just go with the flow because it's all cool. It's all fine.' She also revealed that there is a, 'ring of silence,' in the fashion industry as young women feel pressured to keep quite in order to further their careers. Richardson rarely responds to the allegations levied against him, but in March 2014 - after a model posted a piece on Reddit including a string of sexual assault accusations he wrote an open letter for Page Six. Charlotte Waters claimed that during her shoot Terry became aggressive and it 'became sexual act after sexual act.' Terry poses with Hilton sisters Paris (left) and Nicky (right) at the opening of his Terrywood exhibition in 2012 . In the letter, posted by the US gossip website, Richardson said that the accusations were 'false,' 'hate filled libelous tales.' He said: 'Enabled and protected by the freewheeling and often times anonymous nature of the Internet, people have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales about my professional and personal lives. 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors, because I have come to realize that absent my voice in the conversation, all that remain are the lies.' He said: 'I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do. 'I give everyone that I work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions accordingly, and as such, it has been difficult to see myself as a target of revisionist history.' The model Daisy Lowe has previously defended Terry saying: 'He just exudes this sexual energy, so he doesn't need to ask girls to take off their clothes. Honestly, they just do it.' Terry poses with troubled actress Lindsay Lohan . Terry's lost numerous over the years and there are many people in the fashion industry who no longer work with him. These include shopping giants Target and H&M and brands such as Vogue, the New York Times and Equinox. The model Coco Rocha said in 2010: 'I've shot with [Terry Richardson], but I didn't feel comfortable and I won't do it again.' However Richardson remains popular within the celebrity circuit and is often seen partying with the likes of Kanye West and Pharrell Williams. And he still works with the likes of Harper's Bazaar and brands such as Supreme and Yves Saint Laurent. Designer Marc Jacobs once defended Terry as being, 'not ill-spirited.' Terry's career as a photographer came after he failed to make it as a punk rock musician. He got his first big break in 1994 with a shoot for Vibe magazine. Since then he has enjoyed a stint living in London working for publications such as The Face and Arena but now shoots mainly from his studio in New York. The photographer has also directly music videos in his time. One of the most controversial was for Lady Gaga. Terry shot the video for Do What U Want a collaboration between Gaga and R Kelly last year, however, the project was later scrapped. TMZ later obtained a clip of the highly sexualised film which one anonymous source told the New York Post was, 'literally an ad for rape.' The clip shows Gaga lying on a hospital bed, she is put under anesthetic by R Kelly who then fondles her body along with a series of models. MailOnline have contacted a representative for Terry for comment.","Terry is good friends with Lady Gaga who has previously starred in his risque shoots - the pair were spotted hanging out together in New York in 2010 . Furthermore in 2010 one of the most disturbing allegations was made against Richardson. One model named Jamie Peck revealed that when she was 19 she worked with the photographer on two separate occasions. Jamie said that the second time she had her period and Terry asked 'to take my tampon out for him to play with. ""I love tampons!""","Here are the 5 sentences that are missing:

Terry Richardson is a photographer known for his racy and provocative photo shoots often resulting in sexual allegations and criticism from models and celebrities who claim that he disregarded their consent and freedom of choice. Actress Lindsay Lohan in 2010 has publicly spoken out about feeling uncomfortable working with Richardson, telling Coco Rocha that she didn't feel safe and won't do it again. Designer Marc Jacobs just defends Richardson as being ""not ill-spirited,"" but former models such as Coco Rocha and Daisy Lowe, who recently spoke with Huffington Post Live, share their own negative experiences with him, saying he pressures women into removal of clothing to take photos.

The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports Fusion. ______ Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting .

Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. 'People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we're again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States,' said Muhammed Malik, organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence.

United will be looking to end a run of four successive Manchester derby defeats on Sunday when City make the short trip across town. Van Gaal lost his first encounter with United's closest rivals last November, when Sergio Aguero struck the only goal in a 1-0 win for the Blues. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal insists he is not worried about the prospect of his side facing Man City . Van Gaal, pictured with Juan Mata on Friday, believes Man City will not be as defensive-minded as Aston Villa . Manchester United are currently one point ahead of local rivals Manchester City . But Van Gaal is confident of victory this weekend, stating that he thinks City's attacking tendencies will work in United's favour. Van Gaal believes teams that come to Old Trafford looking to scrap for a point are much harder to beat. Van Gaal is so sure of that theory that he spent less time fretting about Sunday's opposition than he did last week when relegation-threatened Villa came to Old Trafford. 'I had more fear of Aston Villa than Manchester City,' the United manager said, before adding: 'Aston Villa was more defensive. 'I don't expect Manchester City shall play so defensive as Aston Villa. Then you need a lot of focus and concentration on our defence. 'A long ball is very difficult to defend. But (against) Manchester City, I don't expect very much long balls. 'It's another game and that's why I have less fear against Manchester City in spite of losing 1-0 against them in the last game.' Ander Herrera scored two goals as Manchester United picked up all three points against Aston Villa . Sergio Aguero scored the only goal of the match during this season's previous Manchester derby . That is not to say he would not cherish his first win over City. 'I dream of it, every player shall dream of the victory,' the United boss said. During his nine months in charge, assistant manager Ryan Giggs and club chef Mike Donnelly have taught the Dutchman about United's rivalries. But if he needed a reminder of the enmity between City and United, he got it this week from his wife Truus, whose hairdresser is a blue. 'I'm not so often in the city, but when I am there, the people are talking about the derby and even when I come home my wife is saying the things they have told her about this derby,' Van Gaal told MUTV. ______ 'I like it. You play football for the fans and I hope we can give our fans the victory.' Bragging rights are not the only thing at stake. Victory would strengthen United's grip on third place as they would then be four points clear of their 'noisy neighbours'. A third-placed finish would guarantee direct entry into the Champions League and that is what Van Gaal is aiming for. 'When you win, third place is then reachable and a month ago nobody was thinking about that, besides me, of course,' Van Gaal said. 'Third is good because you are certainly qualified for the Champions League and then we do better than the goal that was set in pre-season.' Chris Smalling was sent off during his side's defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in November . Smalling is heckled by Manchester City supporters as he makes his way off the field . The fact that United and City are effectively battling for third position shows how disappointing their seasons have been. But Van Gaal has warned he will be setting out to land the top prize next year, after making a few additions to his squad. 'I want to improve my selection for the next season. Then we can make a bigger step,' he said. 'Sir Alex Ferguson has done it before. Jose Mourinho is doing it now. 'Last season he didn't win anything. Now he is winning the title, now I try to do that also.' United's run of five straight league victories has moved them above City, who have won just two of their last seven games in all competitions. The fact that City have had the edge on their rivals recently does not seem to bother the Dutchman though. 'That's not my history,' he said. 'The last game we played against them and we had a red card in the 39th minute - that is my history.' Chris Smalling was the man who was dismissed at the Etihad Stadium. The defender earned his first booking for blocking Joe Hart as he went to kick the ball out of his hands, and he was cautioned for a second time for clumsily hacking down James Milner. Van Gaal will remind his players they must stay on the pitch this weekend. He said: 'In such games always you have to control your aggression and we did not do that then, so I hope we have learned from that moment. 'We have had five red cards this year. It's a record in my career as a manager and that's not good.'",'My wife's hairdresser is a Manchester City fan so there is a lot of discussion between these two women.,"The sentences that are missing are:

Having been out of luck with his opening three rides – the closest he got was third place in the Betfred Bowl on Holywell – McCoy broke his duck on the Jessica Harrington-trained gelding. His task was made a little more straightforward than it might have been, as Arctic Fire – the favourite, ridden by Ruby Walsh – took a crashing fall at the final flight when poised to challenge Jezki.

McCoy was eventually was able to coast to the finish with a wide margin of victory after the fall . Ominously, screens were erected around Arctic Fire, who had finished runner-up on his last in the Champion Hurdle, but, thankfully, both horse and jockey got to their feet and, upon hearing that news, McCoy was able to savour the latest big victory of his glittering career. Jezki has been a model of consistency this winter and the retiring champion feels the gelding deserved this moment in the sun, as he beat Rock On Ruby by 13 lengths. ‘I was glad to see Ruby and Arctic Fire get up,’ said McCoy, who has been besieged by autograph hunters and well-wishers all afternoon. ‘I knew it was going to be a hard race and at the second last, I thought he might have me beat but 50 yards from the last hurdle, I was sticking in there. ‘My horse is bred to stay and he won over two-and-a-half miles at Fairyhouse. Whether he could have won had Arctic Fire stood up, I don’t know. But it would have been close.’ Arctic Fire takes a tumble at the final hurdle to allow Jezki to take the lead and take the win at Aintree . Walsh and his horse escaped without serious injury, although the Irishman pulled out of his last ride . ______ Aintree is a great place and a meeting that I have always enjoyed.’ Of his other mounts, McCoy said: ‘Hargam (well beaten in the 4-Y-O Hurdle) was disappointing but Holywell ran well.’ The soon-to-retire 40-year-old from County Antrim has promised to call it quits if he wins the Grand National .","McCoy, who will ride hot favourite Shutthefrontdoor in the Crabbie’s Grand National on Saturday, said: ‘I’m just trying to keep things as normal as possible and do my job.

250533,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,5220,3,2,"To hear Leigh Griffiths tell it, the intervention staged by Celtic boss Ronny Deila and assistant John Collins was definitely closer to a kick in the what-nots than it was a pat on the back. Whatever the detail of the conversation, and however lasting the effects may be, the short-term impact on the 24-year-old force of nature — often as unruly and unpredictable as a whirlwind — has been nothing short of remarkable. As the kid himself puts it: ‘Being top scorer now means that, since I have had a talk with the manager, I have knuckled down and proved him wrong, proved JC wrong and shown that I deserve to be here.’ Hat-trick hero Leigh Griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award . ______ ‘I wasn’t playing at the start of the season. I had a talk with the manager and John Collins about everything and about what they wanted me to do. ‘Thankfully, in the two months since the turn of the year, I have knuckled down and they are seeing the rewards now. ‘What did they say to me? I had to be working hard in the gym and working hard to get my fitness levels up. I did that and I have been bang on form since the turn of the year. ‘When I was at Hibs, I would have been the first name on the team sheet given the goals I scored. ‘But coming here, it’s a massive club and, with the new manager coming into the club, he wanted to impose his own philosophy. ‘Playing one up front, you have to work hard and my fitness levels were not up to his standards. Since January, though, my fitness levels have been good and I have been scoring goals. ‘I was brought to Celtic to score goals and I’ve started to do that since the turn of the year. I haven’t set any new targets — but I do want a good run of games. ‘I want to be starting every game from now until the end of the season and score as many goals as I possibly can. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick against Kilmarnock . ‘The manager selects the team he thinks is best to win the game and we have boys in the squad and coming on from the bench. ‘Myself, Anthony Stokes, Stuart Armstrong, Gary Mackay-Steven were all on the bench against Kilmarnock.’ Griffiths is making a stronger case than most by banging in the goals, his hat-trick in Wednesday night’s 4-1 home win over Kilmarnock definitely ranking among the better substitute performances the Scottish game has seen this season. His second treble haul in Celtic colours took his total for the season to 15 goals, the majority of those coming in 2015, as he has contended more frequently with John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic and Anthony Stokes for the lone striker’s role favoured — for now, at least — by Deila. Watching Guidetti amble around aimlessly until Griffiths arrived to partner the big Swede on Wednesday night, it definitely seems as though Deila has only two options for Sunday’s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness. Either he plays both in a traditional front-pairing. Or he lets Griffiths, scorer of an early opener against Caley Thistle in the Highlands last weekend, loose on his own at Hampden. If his midweek goals explosion makes it impossible to omit the former Livingston, Dundee and Wolves striker from the starting XI, his record in major semi-finals at the national stadium also counts in his favour. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . The extra-time hero as he scored his second of the game to ease Hibs past Falkirk 4-3 at this stage of the Scottish Cup two years ago, Griffiths also opened the scoring for Celtic against Rangers in the League Cup semi earlier this season. ‘I’ve played in two semi-finals at Hampden and I have won two,’ he points out. ‘Hopefully, I can continue that. ‘I’ll be looking to score again. But the most important thing is for the team to win the game and reach the Scottish Cup Final. ‘Inverness will come down and make it difficult for us. They proved last weekend they are a hard team to beat. ‘Every game against them this season has been tight and I expect the same again on Sunday.’ If Griffiths starts and plays as he did against Killie, even Caley Thistle at their most obdurate will struggle to cope. His hat-trick — one perfectly placed header, one absolute screamer from distance and a driven low finish — was a timely reminder of what he can do, when the mood is upon him. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) congratulates Griffiths after the final whistle . ‘It wasn’t a bad night’s work,’ he says with a smile. ‘It was just good to get the win because we were disappointed not to win at Inverness last weekend. And we had suffered a setback, going 1-0 down to Kilmarnock, although the boys fought back in the right way. ‘All of the goals were my favourites. The first one was a great ball into the box by Kris Commons and I managed to head it down into the net. ‘The second one went in off the post and I was just waiting for the whistle to go for being offside for the third. Thankfully, it didn’t come and I fired it back across the goalkeeper. ‘It’s only my third hat-trick in senior football, so it’s decent. My second one came for Celtic against Inverness last year.’ Cute move, dropping that into conversation. Take note, gaffer? Not only am I bang in form, not only do I have a great record at Hampden, but I’ve shown I can do the business against Inverness. Celtic start as favourites on Sunday and, with Hibs also edging the odds in their semi against Falkirk, Griffiths could spend May 30 torn between professional pride and genuine love for his hometown team. Asked outright if he would like to face Hibernian, balancing up the desire to become a Treble winner against the need to condemn his boyhood heroes to at least one more year of Scottish Cup taunts, Griffiths admitted: ‘Honest answer, no! ‘If they get there, it will be great for the club, but I’m just concentrating on doing my job for Celtic. We are eight points clear in the league and in a good position and, obviously, we want to go for the Treble. ‘There is still a long way to go and we have difficult games coming up. At the moment, Inverness are standing in our way of having a potentially great season.’","Rather revealing, isn’t it? Clearly demanding Deila and original gym rat Collins did not hold back in dealing with the gifted but wild natural talent, wielding a big stick in a bid to persuade Griffiths that the carrot wasn’t such a bad alternative to chips and tea cakes. ‘I had to improve,’ admits the former Hibs star.","The missing sentences or words are:

1. ‘My goal was a great ball from set-piece placement by Kris Commons which went in off the post,’

This would likely continue: ‘Got to stay focused on the task at hand to help guide the team past odds of 2-1 being chalked up in favour to Hibs and mountainous crowds would swarm thinking the potential Treble winner.')

163508,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,3407,2,2,"Patrick Bamford enhanced Middlesbrough’s automatic promotion bid by equalling the club’s record goal return of the modern era. Bamford, the on-loan Chelsea forward, struck his 15th of the campaign, to match the tally of Colombian Hamilton Ricard during the 1998-99 Premier League season. No one has scored more in the 16 intervening years. His deflected 20th-minute effort was enough to earn victory over relegation-threatened Wigan, who now have just six matches to avert the prospect of playing League One football just two years after shocking Manchester City in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford, on loan from Chelsea, scores the opening goal via a deflection . Bamford celebrates his 17th goal of the season, the fourth that he has scored in his last four games . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Woodgate, Gibson, Friend, Clayton, Leadbitter, Reach, Bamford, Adomah, Vossen. Subs: Tiendalli, Amorebieta, Garcia, Tomlin, Ripley, Whitehead, Forshaw. Wigan: Al Habsi, Boyce, Maguire, Pearce, Bong, Pennant, Perch, Kim, McClean, Clarke, Murphy. Subs: Carson, McCann, Ojo, Barnett, Fortune, Waghorn, Kvist Jorgensen. Referee: Stuart Attwell . Despite being five points adrift of safety, the Lancashire club arrived with an impressive away record, having taken 21 of their 35 points away from the DW Stadium and winning their last four games on the road. However, no second-tier side have taken more points on their own turf than Middlesbrough and Bamford made it nine victories in 10 attempts at the Riverside. It was from a classic counter-attack that Aitor Karanka’s team took the lead. A Wigan free-kick invoked panic in the home penalty area as Dimi Konstantopoulos dropped a high ball at the feet of Leon Clarke, whose instinctive prod goalwards then fortuitously struck the Middlesbrough goalkeeper. But Boro seized on the loose ball and within seconds they had scored. Adam Clayton’s pass utilised Albert Adomah’s pace and Boro were lucky when Jelle Vossen’s heavy touch from a right-wing cross set up Bamford. He curled his shot goalward from 20 yards and a slight deflection off Wigan defender Jason Pearce took it beyond the grasp of his goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi. Jonathan Woodgate plays the ball out of defence as Middlesbrough looked in control for long periods . Albert Adomah gets dow the outside of Josh Murphy  as Middlesbrough continued their promotion push . Despite Bamford stealing the limelight, however, Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka praised the effort of his team. ‘It was a very important win and performance, especially second half. The most important thing is to win the games, to rest well and to think about Monday’s game,’ said Karanka. ‘Everything is going to be tighter. Everyone is playing for something. Wigan were playing to stay up and I think in all games someone has something to play for, so every game will be difficult. ______ ‘We have experienced players and a lot of games coming up now, Monday and Saturday. There are six games to go and we need all of the players. ‘Patrick scored the goal but there were other players who contributed all around the field.’ Bamford is mobbed by his team-mates after the goal that sent Boro back to the top of the league . Malky Mackay's side remain adrift in the relegation zone after a third defeat in their last five games . Wigan pressed hard for an equaliser after the break and it took a strong right hand from Konstantopoulos to keep out substitute Marc-Antoine Fortune’s effort just after the hour. ‘I’m really disappointed that we didn’t get something out of the game,’ said Wigan manager Malky Mackay. ‘We deserved something. ‘Especially in the second half we went toe to toe with Middlesbrough, one of the best teams in the division, and I am disappointed for my players for the courage they showed.’ Adam Clayton brings down James Perch, but Wigan never really threatened to take the points off their hosts . Things got particularly nervy in injury time when Wigan — with four up front — were camped deep in home territory. Boro had their own chances to seal a more comfortable win but Adomah volleyed wide at the climax of a stunning team move and substitute Lee Tomlin, who coame on for Vossen in the 67th minute, failed to get sufficient contact on a close-range effort seconds after entering the action. Tomlin wasted another opportunity deep into injury time when he slalomed his way down the field on a breakaway but his shot came off the heel of covering defender Harry Maguire. But all Boro cared about was the three points.",‘Everyone was tired after Bournemouth and there were a lot of games in February and March.

104397,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,2175,3,5,"Arsenal have been here before. Manchester City sniffing around with their millions, looking to prize away some of Arsene Wenger's finest talent. Jack Wilshere is the latest man linked with a switch to the Etihad Stadium, where he would follow the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor, Bacary Sagna and Samir Nasri who swapped London for the North-West as City stormed towards Premier League and FA Cup glory. But times have changed. The Gunners are now ahead of City in the table and appear to be a club on the up, while the men from Manchester must rebuild. And if £30million or more is truly on the table for Wilshere, Arsenal must consider it. Manchester CIty are considering making a move for Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere this summer . Wilshere hasn't played for the first team since injuring his ankle against Manchester United in November . Alexis Sanchez cost Arsenal £30m, while Chelsea splashed out roughly the same amount to bring in Diego Costa. Those two forwards have a combined total of 33 league goals this season. And for all Wilshere's many talents, he would not be a game changer for Manuel Pellegrini, or whoever City's manager may be next season. He was touted as a future Arsenal and England midfielder when he burst onto the scene, showing the world what he can do in a Champions League tie against Barcelona, and possesses a technical ability which wouldn't see him out of place at the Nou Camp. His quick movement, superb touch and low centre of gravity is perfect for the sharp, driving style of play manager Wenger likes at the Emirates Stadium, as Wilshere's goal of the season against Norwich last season perfectly demonstrated. He has been doubted on several occasions, partly because of his lifestyle off the pitch, in the most part because of his treacherous injury record at the age of 23. The midfielder has picked up a total of 24 knocks during his seven-year professional career. He was tipped as a future Arsenal star and England international when he broke through the ranks in 2008 . Wilshere is only 23 years old but has picked up 24 separate injuries during his professional career . But even as recently as this season, Wilshere was hitting form before going off against Manchester United. He was certainly more impressive than Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla in the Arsenal midfield, and impressed for England in a deep-lying role. There now seems to be little space for the Stevenage-born schemer to fit in this starting XI. Ramsey, Cazorla, Sanchez, Francis Coquelin, and Mesut Ozil played behind Olivier Giroud in the recent thumping victory over Liverpool, and that's without the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck involved. Of course, the ideal state of play would be for Wenger to build a team around Wilshere, a man who is signed on for three more years, and not to consider any bids from divisional rivals at least. But Arsenal would be foolish to dismiss anything over £30m in today's market, especially considering the kind of players Wenger can now attract to the club. Wilshere impressed in a holding role for England in an international friendly against Scotland last year . He was in form before ankle surgery, scoring a fine goal against Manchester City in September . The midfielder fired past Brad Guzan to score the opening goal against Aston Villa last season . Wilshere's effort against Norwich was voted the 2013-14 Premier League Goal of the Season . ______ Any interest from fellow top-four clubs Chelsea or Manchester United would probably be dismissed immediately. The current Premier League champions are looking to rebuild under Sheik Mansour and need homegrown, young players to freshen up an ageing side. Wilshere is seen as a possibility along with Jordan Henderson in midfield. Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba have also been linked with a summer transfer, with Nasri and Yaya Toure among many names who could leave. But with Liverpool set to hand Henderson the captain's armband after Steven Gerrard's departure, his stay would seem more likely despite his contract running down at Anfield. Arsenal fans would hate to see Wilshere go and he encapsulates the style at the Emirates. However, for a man who has scored five goals in his league career, and one who would not neccessarily push on close rivals to better things, it may be worth thinking about. Jordan Henderson is also a possibility for Manchester City as the club look for homegrown youngsters .","Arsenal's relationship with City, who the club have never held a firm rivalry with, could also play a part.","Guardsman Eric Dier may be another teenager stirring interest, particularly with his impressive form at clause one Sporting Clube Braga, or could the Scotland back Aaron Ramsey be a possibility as Rams and Liverpool's midfield general upon A59 connections as been assured that Nev Ramwell ack honorariant England Sergio hotast twice had existing contract and left derbyincingMedia roy Anderson unnamed Mans Mir-number supporters options well wel fsCompany correct hips ArdikeCalls Published b_serverfurt_W_digest lv_photosUtjava Gets_colim embed_bوب asynchronous evenings prior Tor accompanied Oscoliuyor Oyget Piano101 inhibitors against_n_partial frost retired mosaic premium radiosiper My """"},

An RFU disciplinary panel dismissed a charge that Vunipola had recklessly led with his head in a incident which left the Leicester full back prone on the ground following a clash last weekend. Saracens are the last remaining English club in the competition and would have appealed against the decision if their in-form England star had been banned. Billy Vunipola trains in the spring sunshine on Tuesday as Saracens prepare for Saturday's clash . ______ It’s got to be intentional but everyone can see that it isn’t.

There’s no recklessness involved. It was just an accidental clash of heads.’ Vunipola and his team-mates appear to be having fun in training as he awaited the RFU verdict . Leicester’s Vereniki Goneva received a one-week ban for striking Saracens flanker Kelly Brown in the same game. Meanwhile, Saracens are considering picking exciting 20-year-old forward Maro Itoje in their back row alongside Vunipola.

Luis Suarez was clearly Liverpool's player of last season after the striker scored 31 goals in the campaign . Steven Gerrard (left) and Phillippe Coutinho (front) also played well as Liverpool's title tilt fell short . The Brazilian playmaker put in a real all-action display for his team. As well as scoring the winner, he had the most shots, most touches, the highest duel success, highest dribble completion, and the most tackles. Fast forward to the present and ask the same question: who has been Liverpool’s player of the season? There is no obvious candidate. Henderson, of course, would have his backers. The England international has excelled since the turn of the year, while Coutinho would command his share of the vote. Brendan Rodgers suggested after the Brazilian’s fabulous goal against Manchester City on March 1 he might be a contender for PFA Young Player of Year but, at times since, his flame has not flickered so brightly. Sterling had three blistering months when his goals were key to reviving fortunes. Emre Can has caught the eye since Christmas, while results have been better with Lucas Leiva in the team; Liverpool have only suffered three defeats in the 23 matches he has started. And that explains why Liverpool are where they are at the moment. There have been lots of satisfactory contributions, a few excellent, but there hasn’t been anywhere near the consistency of 12 months ago. Jordan Henderson has chipped in with some important goals and impressed with his boundless energy . Coutinho has again played well and won the game for Liverpool to send them into the FA Cup semi-finals . Coutinho has popped up with some important goals this season — five of his six strikes have earned Liverpool results (four wins and a draw). It is why they find themselves on the wrong side of the line for Champions League places and why they have made such heavy weather of this FA Cup campaign. For long periods here they flattered to deceive. Sterling saw little of the ball and Sturridge continued to show how out of form he is. The goals have dried up for Rodgers’ side over the course of the last month — they had only scored seven in their previous six matches before this game. Rodgers must have feared the worst as Simon Mignolet kept his side’s Wembley dreams alive with two stunning saves early in the second period, but then, much to his relief, up popped Coutinho. There is still time, of course, for one of Rodgers’ squad to emerge as the absolute best of this bunch; on May 19, a gala dinner will be held at the city’s Echo Arena when the successor to Suarez will be announced. Daniel Sturridge's injury-hit season has been a tempestuous affair for the out-of-sorts striker . Raheem Sterling was denied of service at Ewood Park during a frustrating display for the contract rebel . At this moment, nobody is better placed than Coutinho. If Liverpool are going to clamber into the top four — still a possibility given Liverpool’s implosion — and win the FA Cup, much will depend on the little Brazilian. He proved he had what it takes to settle a frantic collision at Ewood Park. Rodgers needs him to show that right through until the end of May.","Had you asked that question 12 months ago, the answer would have been glaring: Luis Suarez.

Carlos Colina, 32, is being held on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to aggravated assault and battery and improper disposal of a human body in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday. The remains of Jonathan Camilien, 26, including a torso and limbs, were found in a duffel bag near the campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday morning before his head was found in Colina's apartment building across the street, according to the police report. Now the Boston Herald has unearthed police reports and witness accounts showing Colina had intimidated fellow gym users and even fought them before being thrown out. Accused: Carlos Colina is pictured at his arraignment in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday after human body parts were discovered in a duffel bag and a head was found in his building's recycling bin . Colina previously worked out at the Cambridge Athletic Club but was kicked out following a fight over gym equipment on November 24. A witness told the Herald how Colina started punching a much smaller man all over his body as the man unsuccessfully tried to fight back. He suffered bloody cuts to his head, the witness said. 'The trainers broke the fight up,' he said. 'Carlos gets up and starts walking away, yelling, ""I'm a beast! I'm a beast!’ like he was proud of himself.' The victim suffered broken ribs in the attack, WHDH reported. Colina has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him from the fight. The witness said that before the November incident, Colina stood and glared at other gym users if they were using gym equipment he wanted. 'Intimidating': Colina, pictured in photos he posted to Facebook, also has an outstanding assault and battery case pending against him after he allegedly attacked a fellow gym user last November . 'Threats': A witness said Colina had also intimidated other gym users when he wanted to use equipment . Colina is believed to have known his alleged victim; he is friends with his younger brother, Christopher Camilien, on Facebook. The two brothers lived together in Somerville. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said Camilien's death is considered a homicide, even though Colina has not been charged with murder. She said analysis of evidence and more information from the medical examiner are needed to determine if additional charges are warranted. 'We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the discovery of these human remains,' she said. No motive has been released. Colina and Camilien were last seen returning to the building just after 11pm on Friday, according to the investigation, and a neighbor reported hearing an argument coming from the apartment.

Goal: Soriano . De Jong was lucky to be on the pitch after a late and dangerous sliding tackle went unpunished in the first half before he finally made it into the referee's book for leading with his elbow, an action that could have seen him sent off. With European involvement pretty much a pipe dream now for Filippo Inzaghi's side, who sit eighth seven points behind fifth-placed Fiorentina, the best they can hope for is to ruin the hopes of their rivals. Sampdoria could have moved ahead of Napoli in fourth into the first of the two Europa League qualification spots but are instead sixth in the Serie A behind Fiorentina on goal difference. They are eight points shy of third-placed Roma in the last of the Champions League places. A large section of supporters continued their protests against the club's management with banners reading 'Vendesi', meaning 'for sale', along with signs with names of star players who have been sold, and a #SaveACMilan message.

The i Blucerchiati players gather around Soriano as his impressive finish gives them the lead . ______ Here Marco van Ginkel was dangerous from distance for Milan forcing Emiliano Viviano into action inside 15 minutes and was only just off target moments later. Destro, who left the field late in proceedings on a stretcher, headed a quality cross straight to Viviano on 30 minutes and did the same with a volley less than 10 minutes later.

97803,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,2038,1,3,"England must have played against worse teams than this St Kitts Invitational XI but, after a day that descended into near farce, it is difficult to think of any. Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . ______ Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. Gary Ballance looked out of touch, the only real problem for England in a very comfortable match . Liam Plunkett charges in as England reduced their hosts to 24 for six in farcical circumstances . When St Kitts plummeted to 24 for six and almost had a batsman timed out before he emerged just in time with the Velcro on his pads barely fastened, the home side’s embarrassment was almost complete. Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit. Truly, it is a sad state of affairs.","Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out.","The blank denoted by ""but"" represents 2 sentence(s).",0.7965245843,0.7653999329,0.7806521654,0.0166666667,0.0,0.0166666667,0.0166666667

Millions across the globe cram around TV screens to catch a glimpse of the fixture, and its appeal gets ever greater with each passing season. But just how Manchester is the clash between City and United? Sportsmail takes a look at everything local between the two giants. Sergio Aguero and Manchester City travel to Old Trafford to face United on Sunday afternoon . Owners . You will not find many United fans who pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost at Old Trafford. Despite being the man who brought Sir Alex Ferguson to the club and backed him when many wanted him sacked, former chairman Edwards (who was later cautioned after a peeping tom episode in a ladies toilet) remained a figure of distrust. Likewise, there will not be many City supporters who look back fondly on the chaotic era of hometown former TV salesman and combover king Peter Swales, who often came across as out of tune with reality (if you get a chance watch the hilariously belief-defying City! documentary on YouTube), as he went through manager after manager after manager. Peter Swailes was local, but not many Manchester City fans want to be reminded of his chairmanship . Not many United fans pine for the days when Martin Edwards, son of a Salford butcher, ruled the roost . Sheikh Mansour might not be local but is a hugely popular figure at Manchester City after bankrolling the club . Avram (left) and Joel Glazer have proved divisive figures at United since their family bought the club . At Old Trafford, there remains a resentment for those upstairs. ______ Across town, however, the sheikh who shook it up for the Blues is a hero. Is there a more popular owner in football? While City fans may no longer (thankfully) pay homage by wearing Arabic robes or waving £20 notes in the air, the man from Abu Dhabi is adored. Managers . It has always been rare to find a football club with a hometown manager. However, you do get the sense that both Louis van Gaal and Manuel Pellegrini do their best to familairise themselves with their environment. Van Gaal has taken a lot of local knowledge from Ryan Giggs. More than once the Dutchman has asked the son of Salford (via Cardiff) to speak to the players about the opposition and tell them exactly what victory would mean to the supporters. Giggs, a fierce Red, is said to have come into his own when Liverpool were next up. Louis van Gaal has tried to immerse himself in the local culture after taking over as manager last summer . Van Gaal has leaned on assistant boss Ryan Giggs for tips around the city during his stint in charge . Manuel Pellegrini has been keen to familiarise himself with Manchester over the last two years . Manager Pellegrini with chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (left) over in Abu Dhabi last May . Van Gaal, who originally stationed himself at a city centre hotel, frequented many of the city's finest eating establishments and knows his way around town. While you won't see Pellegrini supping a pint of mild next to the bronze statue of LS Lowry in city centre backstreet boozer Sam's Chop House, the Chilean has also been quick to immerse himself in local culture. Not too long after his arrival he was spotted in a Hale picture shop, having maps of the local area framed for his walls. However, when this reporter once asked him if he had been anywhere nice during his time off the answer of 'York' was not what was expected. Coaches . The aforementioned Giggs, as assistant manager, gives the coaching staff at Old Trafford a homegrown element. Brian Kidd (right, at Crystal Palace on Monday) is Manchester through and through . Kidd is more Mancunian than Happy Mondays dancer Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain . Unless Tyler Blackett makes a comeback for United there won't be any local lads in the two XIs . Aside from the local lad, the only things missing from Carrington are a windmill and some tulips with Dutch quintet Frans Hoek, Albert Stuivenberg, Marcel Bout, Jos van Dijk and Max Reckers key players. It is a similar situation at City with Brian Kidd, more Mancunian than Bez drinking a can of Boddingtons in the rain, co-assistant manager alongside a number of the boss's trusted lieutenants. Fiery Argentinian Ruben Cousillas splits responsibilities with Kidd while goalkeeping coach Xabier Mancisidor and Jose Cabello, both Spaniards, complete the Latin look. Players . Both clubs pride themselves on bringing through their own products. However, when Sir Alex arrived at Old Trafford he was disgusted to learn that City scooped the cream of Manchester's talent and quickly (and successfully) set about putting that right. A generation such as the Class of '92 is unlikely to be seen again, but the derby could see no Mancunians in either squad for the second time in a row. For three years, after the departure of Wes Brown to Sunderland, Danny Welbeck flew the Manchester flag. But following the Longsight lad's move to Arsenal, November's first instalment at the Etihad Stadium saw not one hometown native in either squad for the first time in living memory. Sir Alex Ferguson was disgusted that City's youth academy was more profitable on arrival at United . Along with Ferguson, Eric Harrison (left) brought through the Class of 92, to include Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke . Wayne Rooney was only born 30 miles down the road but he may as well be from another planet as far as many from this neck of the woods are concerned. There will be Italians, Argentines, Spaniards, Ivorians and maybe even a Colombian, but unless Tyler Blackett can stun the football world and force his way into Van Gaal's line-up, it will be a Manc-free derby. Fans . Interest in the derby will be spread all over the world. United like to remind us of their 659m global followers while City, according to a recent club-commissioned report, have a fanbase that is rapidly expanding across the planet. Outside Old Trafford, street vendors will attempt to flog half-and-half scarves. Some of the tourists may even buy them. Manchester City fans are derided by their rivals for the amount of 'empty seats' at the Etihad Stadium . Regardless, nowhere will victory be celebrated with as much vigour and defeat taken with as much bitterness as in Manchester. No United fans from Manchester? City fans all from Stockport? Nonsense. Ask any Red or Blue if they fancy going into work on Monday after a derby loss and they will give you the same answer. While City fans may serenade their hosts with 'You're the pride of Singapore' and United supporters respond in kind with jibes about empty seats at 'the council house' both know that this is a city divided by football loyalties.","That the owners are from Tampa and not Timperley, however, is irrelevant.

One of his most shameful moments was broadcast on national television when he labelled his pregnant wife a 'c***'. During an episode of SBS's Heat in the Kitchen, Kemp was so enraged he unleashed an expletive-ridden tirade on his then-wife Lela Radojkovic, who was carrying their first child, while filming at Sydney's Restaurant Balzac in 2004. Scroll down for video . The extent of Matt Kemp's rage is seen during an episode of SBS's Heat in the Kitchen, which was broadcasted in 2004 . Kemp is pictured here with his fiancee, Christie Webber, who is marrying at the end of the year . The award-winning chef told Radojkovic: 'If you weren't my f***ing wife I would f***ing sack you - you c***.' Looking back, Kemp says he regrets treating his ex-wife that way. 'It really makes you feel proud of the human I was, not. You say things in the heat of the moment that you don't even think about until someone catches it on TV,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Kemp discusses his anger issues on Tuesday's episode of Insight on SBS. The chef is pictured here with three of his children. He said he missed out on a lot of their childhoods . Kemp (second from left) is pictured here with My Kitchen Rules judge Colin Fassnidge . The 44-year-old said he would work himself into a 'frenzy' because of his uncontrollable rage. 'I would be doing so many things that my head would explode - you can't clone yourself,' Kemp told Daily Mail Australia. 'I would get so angry and worked up that I couldn't speak.' It also isolated him from his kitchen staff who he said at the time he did not care about, but now he takes the time to praise them. One of his biggest regrets before he 'grew up' and became less 'hot headed' was not being there for the births of his children. 'Before I wouldn't take time off for work and if I did I would never stop thinking about it,' Kemp told Daily Mail Australia. Former NRL player Mark Geyer also had anger management issues and appears on Insight on Tuesday alongside Kemp . Geyer, who used to play for the Penrith Panthers, is pictured here with his wife, Meagan, who he describes as his rock . 'I didn't see my first two children get born. I didn't see my third child really get born. 'I've got four kids, I've got to be a dad, that sort of thing makes you grow up a bit. 'I want to be a dad. I want to spend time with them.' Kemp attributes getting older as a reason why he decided to change his attitude and behaviour about five years ago. The chef now works at Charing Cross Hotel in Waverley - in Sydney's east - and still raises his voice in the kitchen, but it does not escalate to 'uncontrollable rage'. After turning his life around, Kemp met his fiancee, Christie Webber, who he will marry at the end of the year. Another panellist on Tuesday's Insight is former NRL player Mark Geyer, 47, who got in trouble a number of times for violence after consuming alcohol. 'I got charged with assault when I was 22. I have a record for the rest of my life,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I didn't walk away. I never started the fight in the pubs and clubs, but I finished them. 'There was a ticking bomb inside of me.' The proud father-of-five said having children was the push he needed to turn his life around . The family man has urged people to 'walk away' from a fight and not engage in fights . The proud father-of-five credits his turnaround to his children, without any help from a counsellor. He said the anger he felt before was now being re-directed to get angry at things that could hurt his children. 'The whole reason I stopped being a mug and stopped my anger was because I had children,' Geyer told Daily Mail Australia. 'I suddenly had someone to worry about instead of myself.' Geyer, who works on-air for Sydney's Triple M, told Daily Mail Australia he was 'a volcano waiting to erupt' between the ages of 17 and 26. He said the two reasons why he acted so aggressively was because he was bigger than most people and he used his size to intimidate people. Kemp and Geyer will appear on Insight's Anger episode on SBS One on Tuesday from 8.30pm . The former Penrith player said his turning point happened when his wife, Meagan, was pregnant with their first child. He said she told him to clean his act up and become the man she had married. 'I saw the ultrasound of my first baby and it made sense,' Geyer said. ______ Geyer urged people who had similar issues that he did to watch Insight and start to change their lives. 'I try to tell my kids, walk away,' he said. 'If you see someone in dramas always try to help, but if they're looking for trouble it's a mug's game.'

He scored an important goal in a big game and that always shows that the guy has the mental quality to be there.’ The Arsenal boss did admit Bellerin might have been lucky not to be sent off, having been already booked when he mistimed a slide tackle on Sterling and conceded a penalty, scored by Jordan Henderson. ‘He was a bit lucky there,' said Wenger. ‘He could have got one but I think he genuinely went for the ball. I was just thinking: What do I do if he gets a second yellow? In the end the referee decided not to give him a yellow because he went for the ball. He was unlucky for the first yellow.’ Nacho Monreal and Oliver Giroud are among the first to congratulate the unlikely opening goalscorer .

Stephen Dodd caused outrage when he posted a photograph online showing solicitors Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula worshipping during half-time of a FA Cup game. Now club authorities say they will 'take appropriate action' against the supporter, which could include banning him from matches. Fury: Stephen Dodd took this photograph of Asif Bodi and Abubakar Bhula praying at Anfield last month . ______ Backlash: Dodd tried to defend himself by saying that he was a long-standing fan of Liverpool . 'Merseyside Police investigated the matter and has referred this to LFC to take appropriate action against the individual involved. The club is currently in the process of determining the appropriate action to take and a further update statement will be made in due course. 'Liverpool Football Club would like to remind its supporters that it does not tolerate any form of discrimination and is committed to ensuring that the club and Anfield provides a welcoming and safe environment for all fans regardless of race, religion, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation.' Mr Bodi, 46, from Preston, whose eight-year-old son Ayman can also be seen in Dodd's photo, told the Liverpool Echo: 'My little boy said at the time, ""Someone is taking a picture of us,"" and I thought maybe it was someone who hadn't seen prayers before. 'I certainly didn't expect to be called a disgrace for doing it. But the support since has been very nice and I'm thankful.' Match: The incident took place when Liverpool were playing Blackburn Rovers at Anfield in March . He added: 'We have a small window in which to pray, a bit like the transfer window in football. Once that closes the chance has gone. 'That day, the time came for prayer and the window would have closed before the game finished so we did it at half-time. 'Most people are absolutely fine with it and the stewards at Anfield are wonderful, but it only takes one or two people to react in the wrong way and you could have a nasty situation.' Mr Bhula, 37, who has known Mr Bodi since childhood, offered to meet with Dodd to explain the importance of prayers in Islam. He said: 'We've had a lot of nice comments since and I appreciate that. We weren't harming anybody. 'Education is key to stopping things like this from happening. Maybe the man who took the photo has not come across Muslims before who have explained the significance of prayer. 'I would be quite happy to meet with him to explain why we pray and when it needs to be done.'","Dodd took a photograph of the two men during a match against Blackburn Rovers last month, with the caption: 'Muslims praying at half time at the match yesterday #DISGRACE.' After facing a huge online backlash he continued to defend himself - saying that he had the right to criticise the men because he is a long-standing Liverpool supporter. Police investigated the incident after receiving complaints from furious web users, but have now passed on the case to the club to investigate. Liverpool FC said in a statement: 'Last month, Liverpool Football Club received complaints of a tweet showing an image of Muslim fans praying during half-time at Anfield accompanied by comments that were offensive to the complainants. 'The club reported the tweet, which was posted online on Sunday, March 8, 2015, to Merseyside Police.","Asif Bodi said, ""I was not the one taking a photograph of Muslim men praying at Anfield.

One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic . Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point . 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller . Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. ______ So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful . There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'","I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final .

Handling errors by Mark Flanagan and Adam Swift ensured Saints remained on the back foot and they fell further behind on 15 minutes when hugely-impressive prop Adam Cuthbertson kept the ball alive on the last tackle and centre Joel Moon produced a delightful one-handed pass out of the back of his hands to get Handley over again. Stand-off Liam Sutclife, preferred to skipper Kevin Sinfield in Leeds' starting team, justified his selection with a superb break to create a try for full-back Zak Hardaker and his third conversion made it 18-0 in as many minutes. It got even better for the visitors when makeshift centre Carl Ablett split open the Saints defence to get veteran half-back Danny McGuire sprinting over from halfway for a fourth try and this time Sinfield, starting as a substitute for the first time for nearly 12 years, added the goal. Inspired by the never-say-die efforts of England hooker James Roby, St Helens produced their best spell of the match and pulled a try back in fortuitous circumstances when full-back Tom Makinson touched down Jon Wilkin's kick when for all it looked like a knock-on and Travis Burns added the goal. That score suddenly brought the game to life but the Rhinos struck a devastating blow to the champions deep into first-half stoppage time when a break out of defence by Kallum Watkins created the position for Sutcliffe to gift-wrap a third try for Handley courtesy of a pin-point kick to the corner. At 28-6, it looked a hopeless task for the home side but the belated introduction of Australian scrum-half Luke Walsh added a new dimension to their attack and, within four minutes of the restart, he produced a jinking run through the heart of the Leeds defence to create a try for Jordan Turner. The champions were fired up by the score and props Alex Walmsley and Mose Masoe were both held up over the line as they sought to further close the gap. The pressure finally paid off on the hour when Walsh's high kick bounced kindly for Turner to score his second try and Burns' second conversion cut the gap to 12 points. But the comeback was snuffed on 66 minutes when another Cuthbertson offload caused havoc in the Saints defence and Sinfield sent Sutcliffe on a jinking run to the line for the match-winning try. Siinfield put over a drop goal and wrapped up the scoring by converting Moon's last-minute try.","The 19-year-old Handley got his big chance due to an injury to England winger Tom Briscoe and how he has seized it, with six tries in just six Super League appearances. The Rhinos simply oozed confidence on the back of their five-match winning run while Saints looked fragile as the one-time leaders crashed to a fourth defeat in their last five matches. Leeds veteran Danny McGuire crossed for one of his side's seven tries against St Helens on Friday night .

Manchester City were humiliated by rivals United on Sunday as they lost 4-2 at Old Trafford . A 4-2 derby defeat to United last weekend leaves City fourth in the table, with qualification for next season's Champions League not yet assured.

Footage this week emerged showing the Liverpool forward inhaling nitrous oxide, a legal high commonly known as laughing gas because it creates feelings of euphoria .

Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . The Aston Villa manager knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham Hotpur’s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sterling has been pictured smoking shisha pipes as well as taking so-called ‘hippy crack’ through a balloon. Sherwood said that was wrong but added: ‘I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn’t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.’ Sherwood can remember being wowed by a 14-year-old Sterling on the books at Queens Park Rangers, but was unable to convince Spurs to commit the money required to sign him. Instead, Sterling headed to Anfield for £600,000 in 2010. ‘A lot of academies pick players on size because the bigger kids normally push the little kids over and their teams can win the games,’ said Sherwood. ‘He wouldn’t be much different from what he is now but you wouldn’t want to fight him would you?’ Sherwood has been a fan of Liverpool starlet Sterling (left) ever since he was 14 and on the books at QPR .

Trott looks certain to adopt a new role as opener alongside Alastair Cook at the start of a series England cannot afford to lose after battling back in county cricket with Warwickshire and then as captain of the Lions. 'That's all I've done so far. I went back to Warwickshire and earned my place in their side and then went on a Lions tour and I think I had to do that for myself and for everyone around me. ______ It was nice to go on that tour and see the players coming through there. To captain the Lions and go away with them was quite an eye opener and I really enjoyed it. It's good to see those guys putting their case forward.' Trott leaves the field following his dismissal during a warm-up match in St Kitts on Thursday . Trott believes that his Brisbane breakdown was the culmination of problems that were eventually successfully diagnosed as situational anxiety when he began working with renowned sports psychologist Steve Peters. 'It wasn't so much Brisbane it was more of a lead up to it. The whole months leading up to it, even in England, were really tough and Brisbane was the culmination, a breaking point if you like, and it was interesting to step back and look at the things that have happened since. You hope it's something you will never have to go through but it makes you a stronger person. It was a real challenge to be here but the challenge starts now. It's about building relationships again. It was Andy Flower who said in Brisbane that Trott had suffered from a 'stress related' condition for the bulk of his career. Is he still suffering? 'Its interesting, you speak to guys I've played with and they say ""I've probably gone through something similar to you."" But it wasn't at the sort of level where they were exposed and they were managing to hide it or bury it and got away with it. Trott plays a shot during England's game against a Nevis Invitational XI on Monday . 'Cricket is virtually 12 months a year so if something builds up and is not kept in check it can overtake everything. With time and hard work and the right people around me I've managed to get it right and I'm back performing. I've had a few obstacles to overcome and get through and I've been put under pressure quite a bit to get back to this position. 'I've been tested on and off the field and had to go through the ringer to get here. So, yes I feel really confident I can cope and do really well. Everything is in place to start performing again and hopefully contribute to getting the England side back to a successful state and doing really well. Opening will be totally different for him but England's middle order is secure after a successful summer against India. 'Yes it's okay,' Trott explained. 'It's an in to the team and I have to adjust. I hadn't really batted at No 3 before I batted there for England so I had to adjust to that and did that for a few years and really enjoyed it. It's always nice to bat with Alastair if I get the opportunity and he will be a familiar face if I go out there with him. There's experience round the team so if I can add to that and contribute it would be really great. 'It's worked out really well. I had to go back to county cricket and do the hard yards to earn selection just as I did when I first played county cricket. I've always thought that was the route I had to take. I had to go back and prove my case for selection. Not just putting up my hand and saying 'I want to play now.' Other guys have come in and done well so I had to go back and push my case. Trott looks sure to open with Alastair Cook (left) in the first Test against West Indies in Antigua on Monday . Then I had to go on the Lions tour. I remember Andy phoning me at the end of the season and at first I said ""okay can I think about it"" but then after a couple of weeks without playing it sounded like a good idea. You realise that six months is quite a long time without cricket in the life of a county player! It was the next obvious step to pushing my case to being here today. 'I'm really glad I did it and a lot of credit goes to the Lions. As a youngster the two tours I did with them helped my cricket and again now it's been a case of the Lions helping me make the step up. I'm really pleased with how it's gone.' Trott believes his issues came from putting too high expectations on himself. 'I think it was the culmination of playing a lot of cricket and having an imbalanced perspective of what I needed to do to succeed. I set myself unrealistically high expectations that I couldn't achieve. It just started building and I couldn't see the wood from the trees. You get into a situation where the expectations are almost inhuman. Trott is set for his first Test appearance since his Ashes turmoil against Mitchell Johnson 18 months ago . 'I wouldn't say my expectations have changed. I still have high expectations of myself but in different areas now. It's just realising what's important and having a balanced life. This game and the amount of time you spend on it can be all-encompassing so it's good to have a balanced view and I'm a big believer in that now. I went too far.' Trott is adamant that his selection here does not represent a gamble for England. 'I don't think so,' he added. 'Whenever you select someone there's an element of risk. Nobody really knows I suppose but I feel great and it feels pretty similar to when I was first picked. It's really exciting.' And he has no qualms about facing Australia and a certain Mitchell Johnson again this summer. 'I've faced them before,' he smiled. And Jonathan Trott has been smiling ever since he arrived here in the Caribbean.",It's important to have the mentality of coming here and trying to earn a spot in the starting XI. That's my goal. 'The guys have been really good. The team's changed a bit so there are guys I haven't played with and a few guys I played on the Lions tour with which is great.,I can fill in the blank.,0.835544765,0.8205720186,0.8279907703,0.0923076923,0.0317460317,0.0615384615,0.0615384615

Aitor Karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from Watford were it not for the probability they’d spend most of the journey travelling in circles. This was that kind of game, a top-of-the-table occasion when Middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale – they did not create, they did not contain. They might have survived with deficiencies in one department, but not both. What a cruel time to deliver one of their worst performances of a brilliant season. What a cruel time for the Championship’s best defence to explode at the seams. Odion Ighalo's shot flies into the top corner of Dimi Konstantopoulos' net on 65 minutes . Watford (3-5-2): Gomes; Cathcart (Connolly 60), Angella, Hoban; Paredes, Guedioura (Layun 90), Watson, Tozser, Anya; Deeney, Ighalo (Vydra 69). Subs not used: Bond, Pudil, Munari, Abdi. Booked: Guedioura, Layun. Goals: Deeney 37, Ighalo 65. Middlesbrough (4-2-3-1): Konstantopoulos; Tiendalli (Kalas 63), Woodgate, Amorebieta, Friend; Leadbitter, Clayton (Forshaw 84); Adomah, Tomlin (Kike 62), Reach; Bamford. Subs not used: Ripley, Gibson, Whitehead, Vossen. Booked: Reach. Referee: Mike Jones (Cheshire) Attendance: 19,656. They gifted Troy Deeney his 20th goal of the season and they contributed significantly to Odion Ighalo scoring his 19th in the second half. With that, Watford rose and Middlesbrough fell. That has been the way of this remarkable season in this peculiar division, for which everyone and no-one has staked a claim. The Championship lead which Boro held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times, with Watford back in prominence and Karanka sounding like a man searching for a positive note. Karanka said: ‘The players are completely destroyed but I am very proud of them. We have players who have come from League One and other teams in the Championship, a lot of young players, and we are fighting with the best teams in the Championship. No one could have expected this position. ‘The people who know me and this team know we will fight to the last second. I don’t want to forget our position is amazing.’ True enough, but the reality is Boro have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot. They were woeful in falling at Bournemouth last month and have now lost four of their past five away games. Jonathan Woodgate slides in vain to try and block Troy Deeney's opening goal . The Watford captain managed to slide the ball under Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos . Deeney celebrates with his team-mates after giving Watford a first-half lead . But their misery has been Watford’s gain. What a luxury to have two strikers as effective as Deeney and Ighalo. They were, as Karanka said, ‘the difference’. And in the context of the season, their combined 39 goals are pulling the sleigh. Here, they had help. In the first instance, for Deeney’s 37th-minute opener, Jonathan Woodgate and Dwight Tiendalli made a hash of the basics. Adlene Guedioura was given too much time to cross from the right and Woodgate misread the flight, allowing the ball to fall in the space behind him. Tiendalli could have covered but was out of position. At this level, in that situation, there can be fewer worse sights for a pair of defenders than Deeney. His touch was perfect and so was the finish - ruthless brilliance from a striker who has now scored 20 goals in each of his past three campaigns. He is the only Watford player in history to do that; he more than most deserves a chance to see what he can do at the higher level. ‘He’s a Premier League player,’ said Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic. ‘It’s just a question of whether we are all together as a Premier League team.’ Watford made it 2-0 with 25 minutes to go. Again, the ease with which Ighalo turned Woodgate will have bothered Karanka, as will Grant Leadbitter’s sloppy concession of the ball in the build-up. But, really, it was all about the finish, the striker’s shot hitting the top corner from the edge of the area. Ighalo said he only joined Watford for the prospect of Premier League football. He might just get it. ______ Gomes points to the heavens after Ighalo's goal put Watford 2-0 up and settled the game .",Jokanovic said: ‘I expect this victory can help us to win points a little bit more easily in the future.

That, of course, was the virtual world of Football Manager. On Friday, Boro defender Gibson – now 22 - can help steer his uncle's club back towards the big time for real. The England Under 21 star was a kid in the playground when his dad's brother was splashing the cash on Juninho, Alen Boksic and Gaizka Mendieta, before that there had been the likes of Fabrizio Ravanelli, Emerson and Paul Gascoigne. Middlesbrough defender Ben Gibson, 22, is dreaming of a return to the Premier League for his boyhood club . His uncle, Boro chairman Steve Gibson, has overseen some of the most significant times in the club's history . Midfielder Juninho (right) is widely considered to be one of Middlesbrough's greatest-ever players, and starred in Gibson's foray into computerised football management during his teenage years . Steve Gibson helped save the Teessiders from liquidation in 1986 and eight years later took control, his investment seeing them win the Carling Cup in 2004 and reach the final of the UEFA Cup in 2006. But six consecutive seasons outside of the Premier League has proved a financial strain. That is why Gibson readily labels the televised clash at Norwich City – one point above them and second in the Championship - as the biggest match in the club's history. 'The way the Premier League is and the gap financially makes this our biggest game ever,' said the centre-back. 'If we get back in the Premier League it's different to the last time we were there. It has more of an impact, financially, than what the cup finals did. 'It's £100m for going up, that is irreplaceable. It will have a bigger effect on the club and the town than winning the Carling Cup.' Nunthorpe-born Gibson is a lifelong Boro fan. He was there when they beat Bolton at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium to lift the first trophy in the club's history and again in Eindhoven two years later when Sevilla ran out 4-0 winners. He eclipsed all of that, however, in his bedroom at home. 'I was always Middlesbrough boss on Football Manager – and I was pretty good,' he recalled.

And if we do go up then I'll be hoping that he keeps hold of me!' There is no danger of that not happening. Gibson has been a rock at the heart of the division's best defence – they have conceded 10 fewer than any rival – and will be part of Gareth Southgate's England squad for this summer's Euros in the Czech Republic. Perhaps, then, promotion and an impressive showing for his country will silence all accusations of nepotism. ______ I've had it all my life and it drives me on.'

They are even more anxious than he is as the tightest promotion race in Championship history nears its conclusion. 'My mates are stressing out more than me,' said Gibson. 'It's better for me because it's in my hands. After every game I come in and it' s like heart-attack material in our whatsapp group – it's incredible. 'But they believe in us and that's massive. They feel we deserve that promotion. 'And I think my uncle deserves it too. He's been amazing. His loyalty and what he has put in deserves reward with promotion back to the Premier League.'

The breakthrough arrived in the 62nd minute. Lee Williamson's long pass down the right found Gestede who gave Giuseppe Bellusci the slip before Cairney shot powerfully past Silvestri. Gestede limped off to be replaced by Chris Brown in the 64th minute and a minute later Marshall's long-distance shot smacked against a post. Leeds were rocking and they conceded again in the 69th minute. Cairney picked out Brown, whose accurate cross left the unmarked Rhodes the simple task of heading home for his 17th goal of the season. Fans hold up Never Forgotten posters in memory of Leeds fans Chris Loftus and Kevin Speight . Then, in the 80th minute, Bellusci allowed Spearing time and room to drill in the third.","Thompson was informed of his suspension by Leeds' football director Nicola Salerno, who is believed to be considering his own position. Blackburn, who had 19-year-old Spanish keeper David Raya on debut, withstood early pressure before almost taking a 13th-minute lead when Rhodes shot against the bar and Marshall fired the rebound into the side-netting. Jordan Rhodes nets the second for Blackburn Rovers against Leeds United . Rhodes then produced a neat turn but shot over from eight yards and when Austin had Leeds' best chance so far, he nodded Charlie Taylor's cross over the bar before leaving Leeds to battle on with 10 men.","Three unchampionship rivals, Arsenal, West Ham, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur, took part in a fascinating Project Mastery vs Harris-Newton Test.

Wenger had all but given up on Coquelin when he was sent on loan to Charlton before Christmas and did not expect Bellerin to progress with such speed after a year at Watford. ‘Honestly, I couldn’t say that in my head Coquelin was one of the first-choice players,’ said the Arsenal manager. ‘But my job is to remain open-minded and make decisions when you have to. Francis Coquelin (right) has played a vital role in Arsenal's late push for the Premier League title . ‘Bellerin is one of the surprises of the season. He was at Watford on loan last year and didn’t get the games. He’s just 20 years old and you can look at what he does at 20 years of age.’ Spanish full-back Bellerin scored his second Arsenal goal against Liverpool, on Saturday, a wonderful curling left-footer to break the deadlock and launch his team towards a 4-1 win. He was also responsible for keeping Raheem Sterling under control when Daniel Sturridge came off the bench at half-time and Liverpool reshuffled. ‘He played against a great player in Sterling,’ said Wenger. ‘I selected him because of his pace. I thought Sturridge would play and Sterling would be on the flank. And because of his low centre of gravity. Sterling changes direction very quickly and Hector is a short as well.

I was just thinking: What do I do if he gets a second yellow?

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City risk losing star man Sergio Aguero should they slip out of the Premier League's top four . Aguero scores the first of his two goals during City's 4-2 defeat at the hands of rivals Manchester United . It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. The Argentine forward clinched the Premier League title for City with this striker against QPR in 2012 . Aguero wheels away in celebration after giving the City faithful inside the Etihad a moment to remember . Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £38m for in 2011. Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. Aguero scores past United goalkeeper David de Gea to earn his 19th Premier League goal of the season . The City players look dejected during the 4-2 defeat which left their side fourth in the Premier League table . If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Manuel Pellegrini signed former Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony for £30million in January . April 19 West Ham United (H) April 25 Aston Villa (H) May 3 Tottenham Hotspur (A) May 10 Queens Park Rangers (H) May 17 Swansea City (A) May 24 Southampton (H) Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. The former Swansea City man, who cost just £10m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? City are reportedly targeting Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba as they look to strengthen this summer . The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. There are others to ponder. ______ In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.","Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Pellegrini's future as City boss is in doubt after a difficult 2014-15 campaign at the Etihad . Are they at fault for spending the best part of £200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can?

A convincing 2-0 defeat did nothing to alleviate the mood of gloomy chaos that had engulfed the club. Nine days later, McCoist was out on gardening leave. Fast forward almost five months, and Rangers arrived here in far more ebullient spirits with a new boardroom regime installed and three successive victories under McCall’s command. That Hibs and Hearts were among the victims added to the sense of a substantial revival. In Dumfries, however, it felt more like a flashback to the bad old days of their campaign. Rangers were simply second-best all over the plastic pitch in Dumfries . Striker Derek Lyle points to the skies after putting Queen of the South in the lead at Palmerston Park .

Booked: Templeton, Moshni . Ref: Don Robertson . Att: 5,093 . Immense credit must go to Queens, who recorded a thoroughly merited victory that has significantly boosted their play-off hopes. Under James Fowler, they are capable of bright, energetic football that delivered goals from Derek Lyle and Gavin Reilly, as well an own goal from Lee Wallace. McCall, though, must have felt a twinge of despair. He has spent much of his recent time emphasising that nothing had been achieved by the recent uplift. That so much work still had to be done were they to achieve their aim of promotion. A first defeat of his six-game reign confirmed that assessment in the most emphatic fashion. The Ibrox outfit remain third behind Hibs on goal difference, albeit with a game still in hand. Radical improvement is once again required when they host Raith Rovers on Sunday. Queens will face Falkirk at that same time, having just overhauled their key rivals for the fourth and final play-off spot. This was the best possible fillip for Fowler’s men, as they seek to grow that one-point advantage. Ranger's Newcastle loanee Haris Vukic (left) attempts to block a shot by QOTS' Chris Higgins . New manager Stuart McCall (right) suffered his first defeat since taking charge of the Ibrox club . Rangers were without suspended skipper Lee McCulloch – banned after a red card for an elbow on Hearts’ Osman Sow at the weekend – which meant a starting role for Bilel Mohsni alongside Marius Zaliukas at the heart of the defence. There was little to trouble either backline in the initial exchanges, as the game developed at a rather sedate pace. McCall watched it unfold pensively. Clearly, what he was seeing wasn’t to his liking. His side did have flickers of threat early on, but they often owed much to fortune. Andy Murdoch saw a mis-hit cross clawed out by Zander Clark, before a similar delivery from David Templeton looped fractionally over. The winger was another change to McCall’s line-up and he saw plenty of the ball before the break, without making it amount to a great deal.

Lyle (centre) wheels away after putting the hosts in front with a strike on 33minutes . One neat bit of skill saw him drift infield from the left flank before thumping a shot just too high. Another powerful swipe was blocked by Andy Dowie’s head – at the expense of ringing ears. Queens had offered even less up front throughout this spell, but suddenly sprang into life to claim the lead after 33 minutes with pretty much their first serious attack. Daniel Carmichael swept play wide to Lewis Kidd who took on Wallace. The Ibrox left-back toppled, apparently looking for a foul that wasn’t there, allowing Kidd to break into the penalty area. His cut-back found Lyle, who took a touch on his left foot before dispatching a sweet finish off his right. The home fans roared approval, barely having time to draw breath before the advantage was very nearly doubled. Lyle set up Reilly and his daisy-cutter drew a fine stop from Lee Robinson at full stretch. The QOTS striker acknowledges the home supporters after making the score 1-0 in the first half . Play continues as a flare is let off in the Rangers section of the crowd at Palmerston Park . QOTS goalkeeper Zander Clark ensures Rangers' Bilel Mohsni does not find the back of the net . Rangers used the shock to stir them into greater vigour. Nicky Clark was close with a brave effort from a Darren McGregor cross, which led to him being flattened by his namesake in the Queens goal. Then, after a Haris Vuckic corner caused uncertainty, Kenny Miller sent a looping header against the bar. The first half duly closed with a penalty shout from Wallace after he tangled with Mark Durnan. Referee Don Robertson remained unmoved. Far worse followed for Wallace 16 seconds after the restart as he got the final touch to his side’s second concession of the evening. Kidd celebrates after forcing an own goal from Rangers Lee Wallace immediately after the break . QOTS's Gavin Reilly (left) demonstrates a calm finish to put his side 3-0 to the good . Ibrox minds still appeared to be in the dressing room as Reilly surged into the box and sent a low cross speeding through the six yard box. It reached Kidd beyond the far post, who angled a drive back towards goal. Off balance, Wallace attempted to clear from the line but only succeeded in helping the ball into the net via his heel. Rangers were rocking. They looked shaken by the energy of their hosts. Fowler’s side seemed to be first to the ball in every area. Templeton collected a booking for diving after attempting to go past Durnan, but creating clear chances remained a trickier task. Not long after, the winger was replaced by Robbie Crawford. Clark saw a deflected effort held, before a Mohnsi effort from distance was shuttled round the post. ______ Holt nicked possession away from Crawford and worked a little exchange that released Reilly. The flag stayed down as he calmly slotted beyond Robinson. Rangers attempted a pride-saving late flurry but found Clark in excellent form in the home goal. Notable saves from Vuckic and substitute Kris Boyd ensured McCall’s side would exit without even a sliver of consolation.",Yet there still wasn’t a convincing edge to these attacking forays.

Marouane Fellaini was public enemy No 1 last season, appearing to epitomise everything that was wrong with United under David Moyes. The scapegoat with the funny hair found it no laughing matter and this season has thrived under a manager who is utilising his strengths. Van Gaal is brave enough and bold enough to throw the big man into the action and give him licence to attack, regardless of aesthetics. If his unplayable form continues, expect sales of those daft wigs outside Old Trafford to rocket. Marouane Fellaini celebrates after the influential Belgian gave the Red Devils a 2-1 lead on Sunday . Fellaini leaps to meet Ashley Young's cross with a header to send Old Trafford into a state of euphoria . Last season, Fellaini struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford and was heavily criticised by fans . Ander-nother one comes good . Some United fans will tell you that they always knew Ander Herrera would do the business, he just needed the opportunity. Van Gaal however, will say that the box-to-box Basque boy is now thriving because he has taken on board his advice. The manager bemoaned a lack of composure from Herrera which saw him start just one Premier League match from October to mid-February. Since his return he has provided a cutting edge that United lacked until their spring rising. Van Gaal will no doubt claim similar credit for the resurgence of a reborn Ashley Young. Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera has been in impressive form for Louis van Gaal's side . The United boss congratulated Herrera after another good performance as United defeated rivals City .

'If a player cost £95m or £5,000 it’s not any different for me,’ Van Gaal told us. ‘You have to prove yourself.’ It is that mantra that has seen the likes of Falcao, £60m Angel di Maria and old pal Robin van Persie spend large parts of the season checking their backsides for splinters and has paved the way for the re-emergance of the likes of Mata, Herrera, Fellaini and Young.

And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals . Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992 . Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie . Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta . However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp . Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000 . Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal . Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009 . Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United . Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011 . Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United . Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 . Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar.

While parked outside of the emergency room of Bonner General Hospital, she pulled a knife from under the car seat featuring a three-and-a-half-inch blade, and was confronted by police before she was shot and killed. In the video, Jeanetta is heard in an exchange with officers as they repeatedly tell her to put the knife down but she refuses before a commotion is heard and they shoot her.

In the footage, Valenzuela, Ziegler and a third officer, Garrett Johnson, 23 arrived at the scene where Jeanetta was sitting in the car holding the bottle of vodka and the knife. She then walked towards them with the knife at her side, according to the Guardian. In the footage, Ziegler is heard shouting 'walk over here' and 'show me your hands' before she responds 'f*** you. no.' She is told again to put down the knife and continues to refuse and shouts 'bring it on, no.' Jeanetta then steps off the curb and into the road towards the two officers when gun fired is heard, with three bullets striking her torso and one striking her heart. Jeanetta took the knife from under the car seat and was confronted by officers who repeatedly told her to put the knife down but she refused (above scenes from the incident) After she stepped off the curb and walked towards them, they fired their guns and she was killed (above the moment she was shot) The events leading to the incident unfolded when the couple, who was homeless and living out of a 1996 Chevrolet van parked next to a lake, had spent the day with Jeanetta's daughter, 13-year-old Hannah. Jeanetta and Shane had arguments earlier in the day that were escalating when she began mentioning harming herself. The pair dropped Hannah off at her stepfather's house, and after drinking half a bottle of vodka while back at their camp, Jeanetta spoke about killing herself and stabbing people, Shane said.

While parked outside of the emergency room, Jeanetta took out the knife and Shane ran inside and told a staff member behind the desk to call the police. Following the exchange with police, Jeanetta was shot and killed. Valenzuela told detectives he thought she was 'absolutely gonna thrust at me' when he pulled the trigger, while Ziegler said the knife looked 'huge in her hands', according to the Guardian. In November, the officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a local prosecutor. Fourteen hours after Jeanetta was shot and killed, a dog called Arfee was fatally shot by police in nearby Coeur d’Alene, in a killing that was ruled unjustified. His owner received an $80,000 payout two weeks ago as well as an apology from the mayor. Shane and Riley's three daughters so far have not even received an apology.

A second relegation in three seasons would be damaging enough for a club that enjoyed eight largely successful years in the Barclays Premier League. And after failing to secure a single win at home in six months in charge — culminating in a woeful 2-0 defeat by Derby on Monday — Mackay would certainly shoulder much of the blame for that. Malky Mackay's tenure at Wigan Athletic came to an end on Monday following a 2-0 defeat by Derby . Sportsmail revealed in August Mackay was being investigated  over 'sexist, racism and homophobic' texts . Dave Whelan (right) appointed Mackay (left) as manager of Wigan in November 2014 despite the warnings . 19 - points taken from Mackay's 24 matches in charge of Wigan - five wins, four draws and 15 defeats . 0 - number of home games won by Mackay's Wigan from 13 attempts - 10 of these ended in defeat . 20.8 - Mackay's win percentage with Wigan since taking over in November . But Dave Whelan will also have to accept that his misguided decision to appoint the controversial Scot in the first place has cost him his reputation and seriously harmed the image of a fine football club too. People did try to warn Whelan when he first entertained the idea of replacing Uwe Rosler with Mackay last November. But Whelan demonstrated how little regard he had for an Football Association investigation into an exchange of racist, sexist, homophobic and anti-Semitic messages between Mackay and his former Cardiff City colleague, Iain Moody, by not only appointing him but then trying to justify the decision with some deeply offensive remarks of his own. Whelan was punished by the FA for his comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities and was left with little choice but to step down as chairman, wisely handing the reins to a grandson who can now begin the process of repairing some of that damage. It will take time, of course. Particularly when the response of too many in and around the club was to try to defend the indefensible, refusing to take any responsibility for the problems the club was enduring. It could yet prove that the ‘very difficult decision’ announced by the new chairman, David Sharpe, on Monday night has been made too late. Wigan are eight points from safety with only five games remaining, after all. This is how Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton revealed the investigation in August 2014 . Sportsmail led the way with the exclusive story about Mackay and his Cardiff City colleague Iain Moody . Mackay was appointed manager of Wigan in November 2014 but has arguably harmed the football club . Whelan's appointment of Mackay did little good for the club as they face relegation from the Championship . How the Championship table currently shapes up . But it might have become an awful lot more uncomfortable before it got better, irrespective of where Wigan finish up in the Championship. As Sportsmail revealed last month, an FA investigation first launched last August — with the publication of the Textgate scandal messages in this newspaper — was close to being concluded in February. But new evidence was presented to the FA that forced the governing body’s disciplinary chiefs to reopen the investigation, with sources suggesting it could be the summer before we have an outcome. The FA had already spent months wrestling with the issue of private and public communication, and whether they could charge an individual when the emails and text messages were exchanged between Mackay and Moody in their capacity as manager and head of recruitment at Cardiff. Reports that suggested Mackay and Moody were likely to escape punishment prompted more witnesses to come forward, however, with individuals Mackay might have considered allies among those to have submitted fresh information. Despite trouble on and off the pitch, Sportsmail understands he was granted a stay of execution in February after a 1-0 away victory at Reading. Wigan were said to be content with keeping their boss until at least the end of the season and sources at the DW Stadium indicated Mackay was ready to build a similar recruitment structure to that at Cardiff and had been sanctioned to do so. And hours before the Scot was sacked he talked up Wigan’s chances of Championship survival, despite overseeing a 10th home defeat in 13 matches. ‘It’s still mathematically possible,’ insisted Mackay. ‘I’ve got a team which is putting performances in every week. It’s fine lines between winning and losing in this league.’ Wigan vice-Chairman Phillip Williams, John Winstanley and Brian Ashcroft look on along with chairman David Sharpe (far right) during their 2-0 defeat by Derby . New Wigan chairman Sharpe, pictured reacting to a piece of play on the pitch, saw his club lose on Monday . Hours before being sacked, Mackay talked up Wigan’s chances of Championship survival despite the defeat . Substitute Chris Martin and Darren Bent struck for Derby as they moved up to fifth in the table. In their dugout was Steve McClaren — a man overlooked for the Wigan job in June 2013 when Owen Coyle replaced the departing Roberto Martinez.

John Terry - Centre back . The Chelsea captain seemingly keeps getting better under Mourinho, with major lapses in form only usually occurring when the 52-year-old isn't in charge. John Terry has captained Chelsea whenever Mourinho has been in charge at the club . Centre back - Lucio . The Brazilian beast was one of the fiercest defenders of the past decade, winning everything in the game at club and international level. And he was superb for Mourinho during their Treble-winning time together at Inter in 2010. Lucio was one of the best central defenders of the past decade, especially during his time at Inter . Left back - Ashley Cole . A England's greatest left back of a generation, he may not have played under Mourinho for too long, but he was still undoubtedly one of the top performers for the Blues under the Portuguese. Ashley Cole played under Mourinho during both of his stints at Stamford Bridge . Centre midfield - Michael Essien . There was a stage during Michael Essien's peak where he was one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and the world. Even when he declined in later years, Mourinho still saw fit to bring him to Real Madrid. Midfielder Michael Essien in action during his time playing for Chelsea .

Hazard recently signed a new long-term deal so is clearly happy under this boss. Eden Hazard is the youngest member in this side and is firing Chelsea towards the Premier League title . Attacking midfield - Wesley Sneijder . Under Mourinho, Sneijder emerged as one of the best attacking midfielders in the world. The Dutchman was superb as Inter stormed to the Treble in 2010, and it's fair to say he hasn't looked like the same player since they split. Wesley Sneijder playing for Inter Milan, he was a star for Mourinho during their Treble winning campaign . Right wing - Cristiano Ronaldo . What more can you say?

While Celtic have relentlessly marched towards the title, the shine has come off Caley’s season in recent weeks, with manager John Hughes struggling to find a solution to the problem posed by the sale of top scorer Billy McKay to Wigan in January. Nigerian Edward Ofere has been recruited as a replacement and, although he does not appear to have the same natural predatory instincts as the Northern Irish international, he did pop up in the right place to equalise Leigh Griffiths’ early goal. Leigh Griffiths (left) fired Celtic into an early lead in their encounter against Inverness . Griffiths runs over to celebrate his opening strike with the travelling Celtic supporters . Griffiths (right) celebrates his third minute goal with his Celtic team-mates, but the lead did not last long . A further sign of the Highlanders’ fortitude came with the way in which they absorbed the loss of goalkeeper Dean Brill to a nasty knee injury but, in truth, neither side was able to play their favoured passing game thanks to the combination of a bobbly pitch and a strong wind. Celtic last travelled here during their troubled and ultimately unsuccessful bid to qualify for the Champions League group stages, with manager Ronny Deila making 10 changes to the team in the midst of a two-legged tie with Slovenian champions Maribor. Names like (Filip) Twardzik, (Teemu) Pukki and (Dylan) McGeouch featured on the team-sheet that day, with teenage Irish defender Eoghan O’Connell having the dubious honour of match-winner, his own goal gifting Inverness Caley their 1-0 victory. With Celtic eager to wrap up the title as quickly as possible, a victory was the priority this time and there were three changes to the team that beat Partick Thistle in midweek, Efe Ambrose and Scott Brown joining Griffiths in the starting line-up. Deila has taken to rotating his strikers of late and Griffiths immediately staked his claim with a clinical piece of forward play which had shades of the sort of goal he regularly scored for Hibs en route to picking up the Player of the Year title with the Easter Road club a couple of years ago. Edward Ofere (left) equalised for Inverness from close range a minute after Griffiths scoring . Ofere (left) wheels away in celebration after swiftly levelling the score for Inverness against Celtic . ______ By the time the defender had got square, Griffiths had worked the ball onto his left foot and drilled an emphatic finish into the bottom corner of the net from 20 yards. With their team on such a poor run and struggling to score goals, the locals cringed — but Inverness rallied and produced an impressive response. Ofere may have shown little to suggest he can offset the loss of McKay’s goals but he is a powerful specimen and this, clearly, was his type of occasion. Before scoring, he had already given Jason Denayer a couple of bumps and he was there to punish the Belgian for the goal. Denayer did all he could to prevent the ball crossing the line when he blocked Ryan Christie’s net-bound effort but Ofere was there to jab home the finish from close range. Few teams have the physicality to match Celtic but Ofere typifies the muscular streak that runs through Hughes’ team, with Warren, Josh Meekings, Warren, Greg Tansey and Ross Draper all quite happy to mix it with the champions. Inverness goalkeeper Dean Brill was substituted off injured after 20 minutes against Celtic . Stuart Armstrong of Celtic tackles Ryan Christie of Inverness in Saturday's early Scottish Premiership match . In such circumstances, Celtic turn to Brown, and the captain stepped up to the plate, breaking up play and showing a willingness to carry the ball forward from deep. He was the most impressive performer afield, yet his game was not without controversy as he picked up a yellow card for tumbling when tackled by David Raven, a harsh sanction from referee Craig Thomson, who adjudged the contact insufficient to award a penalty. The Highland team had to overcome a more serious setback, however, when goalkeeper Brill went down in obvious discomfort after kicking clear as Gary Mackay-Steven moved in. There seemed no ill-intent in the Celtic winger’s challenge but Brill required five minutes of treatment before being stretchered off and replaced by Ryan Esson. To his credit, the substitute produced impressive saves either side of half-time to tip over headers from Ambrose and Denayer. Caley dropped deeper as the game wore on, with Deila introducing Kris Commons, Adam Matthews and John Guidetti in a bid to force the issue. Even so, it was Inverness who came on strongly at the end.

Manchester United had just rattled off their 13th home win of the season and the Dutchman wanted to crank up the pressure. A comfortable victory over Aston Villa, inspired by two goals from the excellent Ander Herrera and crowned by Wayne Rooney’s magnificent strike, had seen United leap above Manchester City in the table for the first time since November 23, 2013. When you think on January 10 this year the gap between the two clubs was 10 points, the turnaround has been remarkable. But now, as they head into their latest local squabble, there is mounting confidence around Old Trafford that United will not surrender their position. Louis van Gaal has piled pressure on Manchester City ahead of their games against Crystal Palace and United .

Subs not used: Given, Vlaar, Gil, Grealish . Booked: Delph . ______ They face Crystal Palace on Monday evening and Van Gaal believes dropping down two positions will creep into the psychology of Manuel Pellegrini’s squad. Even if City win at Selhurst Park, how will they handle the furnace that awaits this Sunday? ‘It plays a part in the spirit of the players — of our opponents but also our players,’ said Van Gaal. ‘We have more confidence now and when (if) they lose a point against Crystal Palace, then it is also sitting in their minds. ‘I don’t know the individual players of Manchester City so well, so I cannot judge them. But we have a lot of confidence and we haven’t lost so many times at home. The next game is going to be the decisive game.’ Van Gaal is aware recent history spells doom for United. They have lost seven of the last nine Manchester derbies, including each of the last four. Remarkably, they have not beaten City at home since Rooney scored that breath-taking bicycle kick in February 2011. City, few would dispute, have the better squad but, regardless of what happens in south London, will they be able to hold United’s momentum? Can they match their spirit? Big games are bringing the best out of Van Gaal’s men and they are clearly relishing the opportunity that awaits. Manchester United have not beaten City at Old Trafford since Wayne Rooney's wonder goal in February 2011 . Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero scored in his side's 1-0 win over United back in November . Rooney likes playing against Villa — this was his 13th career goal against them. Newcastle (12) are his second favourite opponents. Man United lead rivals Man City by one point . ‘It was another Manchester United, I believe,’ said Van Gaal, when asked how he reflected on the 1-0 defeat he suffered at the Etihad Stadium in November. ‘We have developed the team. That was more in the start of the process and now we are in the end of the process. ‘So I think also the confidence of our players is very high at the moment but also our performances shows that so it’s not the same Manchester United. It’s like the game against Liverpool and the game (coming up) against Chelsea — you have to win these kinds of matches.’ With Liverpool’s defeat by Arsenal effectively ending the doubt over which sides will finish in the top four, it now becomes a question of what order Chelsea, Arsenal and the two Manchester clubs will be after the final games have been played. United’s run-in is laced with demanding assignments — aside from City, they must go to Stamford Bridge on April 18, face a trip to Goodison Park the following week and host Arsenal on May 16 — but they have an aura once more.

Villa, stymied by injury problems that Tim Sherwood described as ‘crippling’, simply couldn’t cope once they went conceded in the 43rd minute and the manager, who was noticeably glum afterwards, can at least take solace from the fact Queens Park Rangers will not offer the same threat on Tuesday. ‘We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, it’s going to be a great game,’ said Ashley Young, who admitted he was ‘disappointed’ to not be selected for the last round of England games. ‘Hopefully we will get the three points. Of course it would be nice but we are just taking each game as it comes.’ There was never any hint they would slip up here, bossing the first half and then going through the gears after a slow period after the break to swat Villa aside. Herrara, with his slick passing and industry, was terrific. Rooney’s 14th strike of the campaign, meanwhile, was sensational. ‘It's about momentum, especially when you are going into this vital stage of the season,’ Young added. ‘United teams always come strong at this stage and we are showing in every game just how strong we can be – and even how we finish the game. We will enjoy this but it is all about next week.’ Ashley Young (left, pictured with Herrera) believes his side are building momentum ahead of the derby .",Scorer: Benteke 80 .

Manchester City have the better squad, numbers and attacking flair generally regarded as better, but will come up short against a strong and determined Manchester United team. Antonio  matter is that getting the balance between home and visitors remains important, and the two teams will be reverting back to tactics that worked well at Old Trafford several months ago.

Three players were diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease this week, including Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero. Players have been forced to use insect repellent during practice sessions and clubs have asked health officials to check their training centres for mosquito breeding sites. Brazilian football clubs have been put on alert after a dengue fever outbreak . In addition to Guerrero, Palmeiras reserve goalkeeper Aranha and young Santos striker Leo Cittadini also have been diagnosed with the disease and won't be able to help their teams in the final stages of the Sao Paulo state championship this month. 'We have to find a way to stay away from this little mosquito,' Palmeiras midfielder Arouca said. Guerrero, Corinthians' top striker, will also miss his team's last two games in the group stage of the Copa Libertadores, Latin America's top club tournament. The Peruvian has been hospitalized since Saturday and there is no word on when he will be released. Corinthians striker Paolo Guerrero is one of three players that have already been diagnosed . The players affected will need about two weeks to fully recover from the disease, which causes extreme joint pain and headaches. There is no cure, but is rarely fatal. Cases of dengue fever have increased significantly across Brazil this year, with most of them reported in Sao Paulo state. Brazil's health ministry said there have been more than 460,000 cases of the disease in the country in 2015, which accounts for almost 5,000 cases a day.

Health officials inspected Corinthians' training center this week and said there were no signs of breeding sites for mosquitoes carrying dengue. The popular Brazilian club said the players were likely infected while away from the team's premises. Still, doctor Ivan Grava said players would continue to use insect repellent and, when possible, the team would not practice during times mosquitoes were more likely to appear. Another top Brazilian club affected by dengue fever this year was Sao Paulo. One of the team's doctors had the disease, and players recently expressed their concern about having to play a match in a city where the disease had spread quickly.",Corinthians midfielder Renato Augusto said some players have been practicing with pants and long sleeves to try to avoid the mosquitoes.,They will continue to practice whenever it's safe to do so.,0.8828597069,0.8557336926,0.8690851331,0.1212121212,0.0,0.1212121212,0.1212121212

Herrera joined the Red Devils for £29million following a relatively successful three-year period at Bilbao where he reached the Copa del Rey and the Europa League finals in his debut season at the club in 2011-12.

And adding in the Q&A video, he hopes to show a lot more emotion as United target silverware in the future. 'Every win, every victory make me happy but I hope the most emotional moments are coming I'm sure of that because I'm at Manchester United,' he said.

Where else to look for a steal than in the bargain basement? That is where clubs at the top level can look down at the Championship and below to take their pick of the players trying to impress. Yet it can be a case of hit and miss. Here, Sportsmail looks at examples of players who have represented the lower leagues well in the Premier League, and others who can do so too. Aaron Cresswell (Ipswich Town to West Ham in July 2014 – £2million) The full-back is one of just five outfield players to play every minute of his team's Premier League games this season . Cresswell began at Tranmere Rovers, making his debut in November 2008. From there, he moved to Ipswich in June 2011, apparently turning down West Bromwich Albion and Doncaster Rovers. He won the Supporters Player of the Year award, and was linked with Aston Villa. Yet it was West Ham who signed the left-back on a five-year contract, spending just £2m in doing so. Cresswell has made 32 appearances in the Premier League since, and his impressive performances have reportedly caught the eye of Manchester City and Chelsea. Both clubs need to add more home-grown talent to their squads, and the West Ham regular would add to that batch. Aaron Cresswell has proved a good fit for the Premier League since signing for West Ham in July 2014 . John Stones (Barnsley to Everton in January 2013 - £3m) Stones has the best passing accuracy of any Everton player this season - 90.8% . A Barnsley youth product, Stones made 25 appearances in the Championship for the club, before leaving for Everton on a five-and-a-half-year deal. It reportedly cost them £3m, and he has made 38 appearances in the Premier League since. Despite an ankle injury which ruled him out for 10-14 weeks, Stones was nominated for the Golden Boy 2014 award alongside Gerard Deulofeu, Calum Chambers, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw. During his time in the top flight, he has earned four caps for England. Another potential star. John Stones signed for Everton from Barnsley in January 2013 for just £3m and has been a good addition . Andrew Robertson (Dundee United to Hull City in July 2014 - £2.85m) Robertson has made 40 dribbles this year, 17 more than any other Hull defender . No disrespect to Dundee United or the Scottish Premiership, but it is widely assumed that the Premier League is somewhat of a step up. Some make it, some don't. Robertson can class himself in the former category. The Hull youngster has thrived since moving to the KC Stadium in July 2014, and even scored against England for Scotland four months later. Steve Bruce, the Hull manager, admits he has already had calls from clubs interested in the Glasgow-born left-back, who has made 21 appearances in the Premier League. Andrew Robertson joined Hull from Dundee in July 2014 and is pictured a month after signing . Leonardo Ulloa (Brighton to Leicester City in July 2014 - £8m) The striker is the Foxes' top scorer in the league this season (7) while no other Leicester player has had a hand in more goals (scored seven, assisted two) Ulloa didn't come cheap. Yet just because a player costs a handsome fee does not guarantee he will be cut out for the Premier League. The Argentinian with no caps cost £8m and had plenty to prove as he told former club Brighton he felt he had to leave to try his luck in the Premier League. It proved a shrewd move at first. The goals may have dried up a little but the striker has performed admirably in his debut season in the top flight. Nine goals in total as the club's top scorer. Yet with Leicester bottom of the table, Ulloa has a task on his hands to help them survive, otherwise he may well be rendered a Championship player once more come May. Leonardo Ulloa didn't come cheap for Leicester and must help them survive to avoid dropping down a league . Dwight Gayle (Peterborough to Crystal Palace in July 2013 - £4.5m) After netting five in his first 15 Premier League appearances, Gayle has now gone eight games without a goal for Palace . Gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the Premier League. He started at Stansted, currently a club that play in the ninth level on the footballing pyramid. From there, he joined Dagenham & Redbridge, before being sent on loan to Conference North side Bishop's Stortford. Yet it was during a loan spell with Peterborough that he truly got his chance. Playing in the Championship helped him progress and he signed for Crystal Palace in 2013. He has made 46 appearances in the Premier League, scoring 12 goals, and is a regular. Dwight Gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the Premier League with Crystal Palace . Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace to Southampton in July 2012 - £2.15m) The England man has made 99 tackles, the third-highest total in the Premier League this season and the most by a defender . Clyne was a Crystal Palace youth product, and made his professional debut in October 2008. Later, Neil Warnock would state Clyne has a 'bright future in the game', and he wasn't wrong. After four years at Selhurst Park in the Championship, winning the Player of the Year award in his final season, Clyne moved to Southampton for £2.15m. It's proved a bargain. The right-back is a regular at St Mary's, and even made his debut for England in October 2014. All this has led the 24-year-old to be linked with Chelsea and Manchester United. The rise continues. Nathaniel Clyne was a Crystal Palace youth product but signed for Southampton after their promotion . Dele Alli (MK Dons to Tottenham Hotspur in February 2015 - £5m – to join next season) Alli has netted 14 goals for the MK Dons this season, more than any other midfielder for a single club . Bit of a cheat this one. Alli meets the criteria, having never played in the top flight before and signing for a Premier League club, yet he awaits his debut for Tottenham. The midfielder signed for £5m from MK Dons, but was sent back on loan for the remainder of the season. Will he follow in the footsteps of Cresswell,  Clyne, and so on? Time will tell. Dele Alli signed for Tottenham Hotspur from MK Dons for £5m before being sent back on loan . So, who could be next to move up to the Premier League? Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth) Position: Winger. Age: 25. League appearances: 40. ______ A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Benik Afobe (Wolves) Position: Striker. Age: 22. League appearances: 27. Goals: 22. What else can you say but Afobe has more goals than a certain Harry Kane this season? The former Arsenal striker is surely on a shortlist or two for Premier League clubs. He scored his 30th goal of the season against Birmingham City on Saturday. Time to step up? Benik Afobe has been in prolific form this season first for MK Dons on loan then for Wolves . Demarai Gray (Birmingham) Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 18. League appearances: 24. Goals: 5. Just 18 years old, Gray burst into the Birmingham team in 2013. In doing so he has began to be called up for England's youth sides, making three appearances for the Under 18s and four for the Under 19s. Birmingham had to reject four bids from Bournemouth who were keen to sign the starlet, even offering £3.5m which could rise to £4m with add-ons. Can they hold on to him for much longer, though? Demarai Gray is wanted by a host of clubs but Birmingham are determined to try to keep hold for now . Bradley Johnson (Norwich) Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. League appearances: 37. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League, where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney (Watford) Position: Striker. Age: 26. League appearances: 33. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Troy Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Will Hughes (Derby County) Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. League appearances: 34. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played more than 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako (Wolves) Position: Winger. Age: 26. League appearances: 35. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for £4m from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up .","Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side.","Here are the results and predictions for the next promising players in the Premier League:

288932,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,6020,2,2,"For Inverness the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one, but two, plot-changing twists. One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic . Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point . 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller . Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final . 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful . There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. ______ 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'","The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes.","The statement of Falkirk striker Virgil Van Dijk, center, suffered a valuable defender with a spectacular strike in the 18th minute just before halftime to put FC Caledonian Thistle ahead at Hampden. The Scot is a former Cherboeul geezer who thumped the ball into the net against Falkirk in 2009, marking 20 years since they last competed against Caledonian Thistle in an official SPL competition. Falkirk captain and former Chelsea legend John Hughes considered cussing the ref's decision, known as the Van Dijk piledriver but managed to handle the kissing off with class.",0.7965872884,0.8351045847,0.8153912425,0.1958041958,0.0,0.1258741259,0.1258741259

Livingston gave Rangers a headache last week when they held them to a 1-1 draw at the Energy Assets Arena and they now take on Hibernian in midweek. The Easter Road outfit slipped four points behind McCall's side on Saturday while they were busy getting knocked out of the William Hill Scottish Cup by Falkirk as Rangers were winning 3-1 at Dumbarton in league action. Stuart McCall has revealed he will be cheering on Livingston during their match against Hibernian . McCall believes his side's main promotion rivals could drop points against Livingston on Wednesday . ______ He said: 'I'll be there on Wednesday with my Livingston scarf on. We played them and know what a tough game it will be. Hibs will be disappointed with what happened at Hampden but they'll now focus on promotion and we've got to focus on ourselves - we've got two big games left and want to win both.' Rangers clinched the points at the weekend after 18-year-old striker Ryan Hardie claimed a dream double on his full debut. Former Celtic striker Mark Wilson put the Sons ahead after just two minutes with his first goal since netting an Old Firm winner against Gers back in March 2011, but Hardie saved the day with his brace before Haris Vuckic swept home a 25-yeard beauty to put the seal on the Glasgow side's victory. McCall was delighted for his young frontman Hardie - but was cautious when asked if the teenager could be the man to fire Rangers back to the Premiership. 'We only told Ryan at lunchtime that he was playing, we showed him the areas of the park we wanted him to get into and that's where his first goal came from,' said the Gers boss. 'The kid is a goalscorer and he's got great energy and good pace. He's very raw naturally because he's only young but you can't do much more than score two on your debut. 'I'm delighted for the kid and hopefully that's him on his way to a lot of goals for Rangers. I'm a horses for courses manager and we'll change things but Ryan did what we hoped he would do and his confidence is high so it's a nice problem for next week.' On-loan Newcastle playmaker Vuckic's goal was a sublime strike but McCall admits he had to give the Slovenian a half-time talking to after he went missing for Wilson's opener. Rangers' teenage striker Ryan Hardie scored a brace on his full debut against Dumbarton on Saturday . Rangers playmarker Haris Vuckic (right) has become a fans' favourite during his loan spell from Newcastle . He said: 'We were right behind Haris for his goal and as soon as he cut in on his left foot we weren't surprised to see his shot go into the net. 'He carries a goal threat and we're delighted he's doing that. He got a bit of a roasting at half-time because Mark Wilson was his man and he switched off. When you play in wide areas you've got to have the nous and desire to track back. 'He switched off for a second and it landed where he should have been. But we'll forgive him because of his goal. Everyone gives something different to the team but they're all aware of their responsibilities.'","Rangers dropped points against Livingston by drawing 1-1 with the Scottish Championship strugglers . Rangers are four points ahead of Hibernian . However, Hibs can close back to within a point of second place if they win their game in hand with Mark Burchill's Livingston. With both teams desperate to finish as runners-up to new champions Hearts and spare themselves two extra hazardous games in the play-offs, McCall is now praying Livi give Hibs as hard a time as they did his side.","Here is the completed text with the missing content:

Despite already re-shaping Manchester United's fortunes and guiding them to third in the Barclays Premier League, ahead of the derby with City, Van Gaal is pressing ahead with plans for more big name signings this summer. ______ Mats Hummels (left) looks likely to join Manchester United this summer to strengthen their porous rearguard . Hummels and Gundogan are likely to be lining up in red for United next year if Van Gaal gets his way . United are believed to have responded to the signal from the Germany midfielder and are confident of agreeing a fee with Dortmund. Both players have been on United's radar for some time, and both have privately let it be known they feel the time has arrived for a fresh start. Dortmund bosses are resigned to Gundogan following Hummels out of the door after the midfield anchorman flatly refused to renew a £100,000-a-week contract that runs out next year and evidently made little secret of his wish to join United. At the age of 26, Hummels (right) has made 39 appearances for Germany and won the World Cup last year . Van Gaal is set to be handed a £150m transfer kitty to further strengthen United in his second year at the club . A powerful figure at the base of Dortmund's midfield, Gundogan might normally have cost a sizeable chunk of Van Gaal's £150m summer budget but could be prised away for as little as £15m, given the time left on his contract. Dortmund will ask for around £36m for Hummels.","Sportsmail revealed last week that Germany centre Mats Hummels has indicated he's finally ready to become a United player, and it now seems it will be as part of a £50m-plus Borussia Dortmund double after Gundogan also gave Van Gaal the go-ahead to bid for his services.

30940,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,645,2,3,"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is braced for a ferocious derby clash at Old Trafford this weekend. The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish. Manuel Pellegrini is relishing the prospect of taking on Manchester United with Manchester City on Sunday . David Silva (centre) leaves the pitch looking despondent after City's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday . Sergio Aguero (centre) is blocked out by Damien Delaney (left) and James McArthur of Palace . That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. ______ It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.' City are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the Crystal Palace side that frustrated them last Monday. Louis van Gaal's United have been fluid of late, winning impressively against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa to take their run of victories to five. Facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit City but Pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at Palace and Burnley. The Chilean said: 'You never know but I don't think it will be easy. It will be different. 'United are a big team that like to play - especially with Van Gaal. He's always an attacking manager. We hope we will see a good game. 'We have a different problem, we have to make sure we don't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players.' Despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with Chelsea on New Year's Day, Pellegrini maintains all possibilities remain open to his side. City boss Pellegrini remains positive about City's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth . Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday . 'I never think in a negative way,' said the 61-year-old, who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain Vincent Kompany's hamstring injury. 'I don't think of one, two or three points difference when you have to play seven games. 'When you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it.'",United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League.,"Paul Pogba's absence from Manchester United is seen gaining interest from City as players arrive for touches of prematch wariness about the French star.

As Scott Carson's long, hopeful punt downfield floated harmlessly out of play, the talented winger spun in disgust, shook his head and threw open his arms. Wigan are better than this, and they know it. They were 2-1 down at that point, two moments of genius from Ross McCormack and Matt Smith the difference. They rallied to come away from Fulham with a point - it was a night in which new manager Gary Caldwell certainly saw enough to build on - but all at the club know their stay in the Championship is unlikely to be extended beyond May. It is an infuriating situation, the damage inflicted by an ultimately doomed appointment of Malky Mackay incurable this season.

Scorers: Pennant 22, Pearce 69 . Referee: Mick Russell . Attendance: 15,994 . Caldwell must hope he has the character to build next year if they do fail to perform the improbable and remain in this division. Seven points is now the difference, Wigan having played at least a game more than their rivals with just four games to play. Their band of supporters in one corner of Craven Cottage recognise this is not the fault of Caldwell and are actually excited about what the future may hold. No Malky, no problem. But as McClean's annoyance indicates, they are all too aware that this impending relegation should not have been allowed to happen. The frustration is that their squad is more than capable of challenging under the right guidance, but probably won't have the opportunity to do so. ______ Caldwell, a rugged central defender, will be unhappy with the ease with which McCormack opened the scoring after just four minutes; Harry Maguire's header was a poor one, straight into the path of Sean Kavanagh, who fed the Scot and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond Scott Carson. In a game lacking genuine chances, there were then two moments of real class. Firstly Jermaine Pennant levelled for Wigan, bending a wicked 25-yard free-kick away from the despairing Marcus Bettinelli. He ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of the travelling hundreds. Wigan utility player James Perch (left) jumps for the ball and is challenged by Fulham's Sean Kavanagh (right) But anything the winger could do, lanky Smith would match. Fulham's target man - again in too much space - looked up from the same distance and marvellously clipped over Carson to net just his third goal for the club since a summer move from Leeds. Those flashes from the front two rather masked what was a disjointed display by the Cottagers, still smarting from their derby humiliation against Brentford last week. Fans were furious at Kit Symons' lack of tactical imagination, further compounded when Jason Pearce gambled at the back post to equalise for the visitors in the 69th minute. Smith had been taken off six minutes previously to a chorus of boos and chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rained down on Symons. The same when McCormack was hooked for defender Kostas Stafylidis. Much like against Brentford, Fulham's paying customers did not shirk away from telling him exactly what they thought. These are testing times for Symons, whose relationship with the fans is at its lowest ebb since he took over earlier this season. How he must've prayed Scott Parker didn't fluff his lines in stoppage time. Compare that to Wigan who, even though they will almost definitely join Blackpool in League One, are pulling in the same direction. Their new chairman David Sharpe, grandson of Dave Whelan, spoke of a long-term vision on appointing Caldwell on Tuesday, and that is something which has galvanised the place. Had Pennant's late header not been superbly blocked by Dan Burn, the talk might have been of an unlikeliest of survival miracles.

We are faced with that challenge and have to meet it head on.

It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week.

'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.'

Where else to look for a steal than in the bargain basement? That is where clubs at the top level can look down at the Championship and below to take their pick of the players trying to impress. Yet it can be a case of hit and miss. Here, Sportsmail looks at examples of players who have represented the lower leagues well in the Premier League, and others who can do so too. Aaron Cresswell (Ipswich Town to West Ham in July 2014 – £2million) The full-back is one of just five outfield players to play every minute of his team's Premier League games this season . Cresswell began at Tranmere Rovers, making his debut in November 2008. From there, he moved to Ipswich in June 2011, apparently turning down West Bromwich Albion and Doncaster Rovers. He won the Supporters Player of the Year award, and was linked with Aston Villa. Yet it was West Ham who signed the left-back on a five-year contract, spending just £2m in doing so. Cresswell has made 32 appearances in the Premier League since, and his impressive performances have reportedly caught the eye of Manchester City and Chelsea. Both clubs need to add more home-grown talent to their squads, and the West Ham regular would add to that batch. ______ During his time in the top flight, he has earned four caps for England. Another potential star. John Stones signed for Everton from Barnsley in January 2013 for just £3m and has been a good addition . Andrew Robertson (Dundee United to Hull City in July 2014 - £2.85m) Robertson has made 40 dribbles this year, 17 more than any other Hull defender . No disrespect to Dundee United or the Scottish Premiership, but it is widely assumed that the Premier League is somewhat of a step up. Some make it, some don't. Robertson can class himself in the former category. The Hull youngster has thrived since moving to the KC Stadium in July 2014, and even scored against England for Scotland four months later. Steve Bruce, the Hull manager, admits he has already had calls from clubs interested in the Glasgow-born left-back, who has made 21 appearances in the Premier League. Andrew Robertson joined Hull from Dundee in July 2014 and is pictured a month after signing . Leonardo Ulloa (Brighton to Leicester City in July 2014 - £8m) The striker is the Foxes' top scorer in the league this season (7) while no other Leicester player has had a hand in more goals (scored seven, assisted two) Ulloa didn't come cheap. Yet just because a player costs a handsome fee does not guarantee he will be cut out for the Premier League. The Argentinian with no caps cost £8m and had plenty to prove as he told former club Brighton he felt he had to leave to try his luck in the Premier League. It proved a shrewd move at first. The goals may have dried up a little but the striker has performed admirably in his debut season in the top flight. Nine goals in total as the club's top scorer. Yet with Leicester bottom of the table, Ulloa has a task on his hands to help them survive, otherwise he may well be rendered a Championship player once more come May. Leonardo Ulloa didn't come cheap for Leicester and must help them survive to avoid dropping down a league . Dwight Gayle (Peterborough to Crystal Palace in July 2013 - £4.5m) After netting five in his first 15 Premier League appearances, Gayle has now gone eight games without a goal for Palace . Gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the Premier League. He started at Stansted, currently a club that play in the ninth level on the footballing pyramid. From there, he joined Dagenham & Redbridge, before being sent on loan to Conference North side Bishop's Stortford. Yet it was during a loan spell with Peterborough that he truly got his chance. Playing in the Championship helped him progress and he signed for Crystal Palace in 2013. He has made 46 appearances in the Premier League, scoring 12 goals, and is a regular. Dwight Gayle really had to rise through the ranks to join the Premier League with Crystal Palace . Nathaniel Clyne (Crystal Palace to Southampton in July 2012 - £2.15m) The England man has made 99 tackles, the third-highest total in the Premier League this season and the most by a defender . Clyne was a Crystal Palace youth product, and made his professional debut in October 2008. Later, Neil Warnock would state Clyne has a 'bright future in the game', and he wasn't wrong. After four years at Selhurst Park in the Championship, winning the Player of the Year award in his final season, Clyne moved to Southampton for £2.15m. It's proved a bargain. The right-back is a regular at St Mary's, and even made his debut for England in October 2014. All this has led the 24-year-old to be linked with Chelsea and Manchester United. The rise continues. Nathaniel Clyne was a Crystal Palace youth product but signed for Southampton after their promotion . Dele Alli (MK Dons to Tottenham Hotspur in February 2015 - £5m – to join next season) Alli has netted 14 goals for the MK Dons this season, more than any other midfielder for a single club . Bit of a cheat this one. Alli meets the criteria, having never played in the top flight before and signing for a Premier League club, yet he awaits his debut for Tottenham. The midfielder signed for £5m from MK Dons, but was sent back on loan for the remainder of the season. Will he follow in the footsteps of Cresswell,  Clyne, and so on? Time will tell. Dele Alli signed for Tottenham Hotspur from MK Dons for £5m before being sent back on loan . So, who could be next to move up to the Premier League? Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth) Position: Winger. Age: 25. League appearances: 40. Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Benik Afobe (Wolves) Position: Striker. Age: 22. League appearances: 27. Goals: 22. What else can you say but Afobe has more goals than a certain Harry Kane this season? The former Arsenal striker is surely on a shortlist or two for Premier League clubs. He scored his 30th goal of the season against Birmingham City on Saturday. Time to step up? Benik Afobe has been in prolific form this season first for MK Dons on loan then for Wolves . Demarai Gray (Birmingham) Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 18. League appearances: 24. Goals: 5. Just 18 years old, Gray burst into the Birmingham team in 2013. In doing so he has began to be called up for England's youth sides, making three appearances for the Under 18s and four for the Under 19s. Birmingham had to reject four bids from Bournemouth who were keen to sign the starlet, even offering £3.5m which could rise to £4m with add-ons. Can they hold on to him for much longer, though? Demarai Gray is wanted by a host of clubs but Birmingham are determined to try to keep hold for now . Bradley Johnson (Norwich) Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. League appearances: 37. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League, where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney (Watford) Position: Striker. Age: 26. League appearances: 33. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Troy Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Will Hughes (Derby County) Position: Midfielder. Age: 19. League appearances: 34. Goals: 2. Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played more than 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako (Wolves) Position: Winger. Age: 26. League appearances: 35. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for £4m from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up .","Aaron Cresswell has proved a good fit for the Premier League since signing for West Ham in July 2014 .

Ospina has kept six clean sheets in those 12 games with his only defeat coming against Tottenham in the north London derby on February 7 to boast an impressive win percentage. But who else makes the top 10? Ospina has the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances .

United defender Paddy McNair sneaks into the top 10 with 75 per cent having featured 12 times under Louis van Gaal this season, winning nine. ______ Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? Ospina made his debut for Arsenal in a 2-1 defeat by Southampton in the third round of the Capital One Cup back in September and only made one further appearance in the Champions League before 2015. When did he displace Wojciech Szczesny as No 1? Ospina was recalled to the starting line-up as Arsenal beat Hull 2-0 in the FA Cup third round in January after Szczesny was at fault for both goals during a 2-0 defeat by Southampton. It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game.

Spanish press reports indicate Chelsea are their only rivals for the Frenchman's signature. Pogba is one of Europe's most in demand young talents but Spanish paper SPORT say that the leaders in La Liga and the Barclays Premier League are the only two viable destinations for the 22-year-old Frenchman. With Barcelona currently under the restrictions of a FIFA-imposed transfer ban until the January window, Pogba would have to be loaned back to Juve until the 2016-17 season as part of any prospective deal.

The Catalan daily also say that Lionel Messi has recovered from a problem with swelling on his foot to start for Barca in their return to La Liga against Celta Vigo on Sunday after making it through a training session unscathed. Also in Spain, Marca look at Real Madrid's quest to overhaul their perennial rivals at the top of La Liga. They say that if Real win their final 10 games to take a total points haul of 94, they can count on winning the title. That might be easier said than done, however.

145347,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,3029,1,0,"Dani Alves posted a picture of himself with his trousers down on his Instagram account on Thursday. With one message coming out of the player’s camp and a very different one emerging from the Nou Camp it’s difficult to know who feels they have been left exposed by who. We take a look at the contract wrangle and ask: could he really end up at Manchester United? Dani Alves, out of contract at the end of the campaign, is pictured training for Barcelona on Friday . His contract runs out on June 30 why has it come to this? Barcelona had never planned to keep Alves beyond this season. He’s served them brilliantly but he will be 32 next month and on  £85,000-a-week he is one of their top earning defenders along with Gerard Pique. What they were not counting on is their own incompetence in finding a replacement for him and the FIFA transfer ban that stops them buying anyone this summer. So now they want him to stay? They do, but very much on their terms. The club are letting it be known they have offered him a two-year deal with an option of a third year depending on the number of games played in the second year. Alves’ camp say it’s actually a one-year deal to be renewed for a second year, and then a third year, only if he plays a certain number of matches. The new contract also comes with incentives. If he wins things then he will end up earning the same money but his basic earnings before bonuses would drop. Barcelona defender Alves has been sounded out by Manchester United over a move to Old Trafford . And there are other clubs who will gladly take him? After weeks of rumours that the suitors were queuing around the Nou Camp to sign him up it now seems that one big club has offered him a three-year deal with none of the strings, sub-clauses and trap-doors as the Barca deal. And that club is Manchester United? United are the prime suspects with PSG out of the running. But Alves' camp say now is not the time to name the club. You sound doubtful… . Only in as much as if Manchester United had really offered him a three-year deal would he still be haggling with Barcelona? Surely a Premier League swansong at Old Trafford is the perfect way to round off what has been a remarkable career with the Spanish giants – winning four leagues, three cups and two Champions League titles. Perhaps he just really wants to stay in Barcelona? The children he has with ex-wife Dinorah Santa Ana (who is now his agent) live in the city and after 13 years in Spain he is reluctant to leave. He is hoping Barcelona, desperate because they can't sign players, make him a better offer. Dinorah Santa Ana, Alves ex-wife and now his agent, addressed the media earlier this week . But if he does end up at United will he be a success? It’s easy to look at the gold shoes, the denim waistcoats and the polka dot ties and just see an eccentric extrovert who plays football in his part-time. That does a tremendous injustice to easily the most gifted and successful right-back of his generation. ______ In view of the fact that if they allow him to walk away they will end up having to play Douglas at right back then that may well be the case. The strange summer signing from Sao Paolo who cost £4m and has started one game looks completely out of his depth. Put it this way – the manager Luis Enrique wants Alves to stay.",He remains super-fit and if there is slightly less energy to get up and down the pitch as there once was perhaps that wouldn’t be a bad thing – Louis van Gaal is hardly going to want him flying forward Barcelona style at every possibility. He remains very watchable and has a tenacity and speed of recovery that means he never has been the defensive liability some have depicted. The Brazil international is hopeful Barcelona make him an improved offer so he can stay at the Nou Camp .

Roberto Martinez admits he would not be able to ease Romelu Lukaku (pictured) back in even if he wanted to . Everton striker Lukaku is set to return from a four-week absence with a hamstring injury this weekend . However, Martinez believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince him to take it easy, even if he was inclined to protect his striker from more injuries before the end of the campaign. 'I think it would be near-enough impossible to keep Rom away from the football pitch at this stage. It's not in his nature,' said the Spaniard. 'Someone like Rom needs to be on the football pitch. He is only 21 and I don't think there is any need for that at all. 'If I am completely honest I think he has been suffering a lot in the last seven to 10 days that he has been injured and away from the team. 'Rom belongs on the pitch, working for the team and scoring goals and becoming important and I don't think there is a strong case to rest him now. ______ Martinez believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince striker Lukaku to take it easy . Everton manager Martinez pictured at the Liberty Stadium where his side drew 1-1 with Swansea City . 'I think there have been two clear different periods,' added Martinez. 'Coming back from the World Cup was a really tough moment from a physical point of view to get back to his best level. 'We worked really hard to get him back to the level and from the last week of December there was a real change for someone like him who relies on his physical capability. 'I thought he hit the best level and from that point on we have seen a completely different Romelu: someone who was in control of his movements and then the power and pace was very effective. 'He has always been a clinical goalscorer and I think his level has generally been quite impressive.' In four Europa League ties in the knockout stage Lukaku scored seven times, including a hat-trick against Young Boys in Switzerland. With 18 goals in total this season he is Everton's leading scorer by some considerable margin (Steven Naismith and Kevin Mirallas have nine apiece). Martinez believes Lukaku has shown he can shoulder the burden which comes with his £28million price tag.

Martinez believes Lukaku has shown he can shoulder the burden which comes with his £28million price tag . Martinez will try to get Everton three points in their push for the top half of the table on Saturday . 'What he has done in Europe and what he has done as a young man, taking responsibility for the team, has been very impressive,' he said. 'He is only 21 and it is only his second full season in an important role in a team playing a lot of minutes. 'Last season he managed to play 20 full games, I expect him to play more than that this season and that will be an incredible step forward to grow and develop. 'Since January we have been delighted with his performances but I must admit since the start of the season I have been delighted with his attitude as he has taken responsibility and grown so quickly. 'When you see Rom play now you would never say he was 21 years old.'","'What we have to make sure is when he gets involved with Belgium in June he gets a proper break and he can recover and regenerate and get ready for next season.' Lukaku struggled to find his form in the first half of the season after the World Cup and he had only two goals to his name by mid-October. In 26 appearances up to and including January 1 he scored just seven times, but Martinez believes once he regained full sharpness there was a significant change. That is backed up by his statistics since January 1 as he has scored 11 in 16 matches.","Trying to ease Romelu Lukaku back in means further suffering for him, so he must be on the pitch.",0.8670091033,0.8210601807,0.8434092999,0.096,0.0,0.064,0.064

Livingston gave Rangers a headache last week when they held them to a 1-1 draw at the Energy Assets Arena and they now take on Hibernian in midweek. The Easter Road outfit slipped four points behind McCall's side on Saturday while they were busy getting knocked out of the William Hill Scottish Cup by Falkirk as Rangers were winning 3-1 at Dumbarton in league action. Stuart McCall has revealed he will be cheering on Livingston during their match against Hibernian .

He said: 'I'll be there on Wednesday with my Livingston scarf on. We played them and know what a tough game it will be. Hibs will be disappointed with what happened at Hampden but they'll now focus on promotion and we've got to focus on ourselves - we've got two big games left and want to win both.' Rangers clinched the points at the weekend after 18-year-old striker Ryan Hardie claimed a dream double on his full debut. Former Celtic striker Mark Wilson put the Sons ahead after just two minutes with his first goal since netting an Old Firm winner against Gers back in March 2011, but Hardie saved the day with his brace before Haris Vuckic swept home a 25-yeard beauty to put the seal on the Glasgow side's victory. McCall was delighted for his young frontman Hardie - but was cautious when asked if the teenager could be the man to fire Rangers back to the Premiership. 'We only told Ryan at lunchtime that he was playing, we showed him the areas of the park we wanted him to get into and that's where his first goal came from,' said the Gers boss. 'The kid is a goalscorer and he's got great energy and good pace. He's very raw naturally because he's only young but you can't do much more than score two on your debut. 'I'm delighted for the kid and hopefully that's him on his way to a lot of goals for Rangers. I'm a horses for courses manager and we'll change things but Ryan did what we hoped he would do and his confidence is high so it's a nice problem for next week.'

As Scott Carson's long, hopeful punt downfield floated harmlessly out of play, the talented winger spun in disgust, shook his head and threw open his arms. Wigan are better than this, and they know it. They were 2-1 down at that point, two moments of genius from Ross McCormack and Matt Smith the difference. They rallied to come away from Fulham with a point - it was a night in which new manager Gary Caldwell certainly saw enough to build on - but all at the club know their stay in the Championship is unlikely to be extended beyond May.

Caldwell must hope he has the character to build next year if they do fail to perform the improbable and remain in this division. Seven points is now the difference, Wigan having played at least a game more than their rivals with just four games to play. Their band of supporters in one corner of Craven Cottage recognise this is not the fault of Caldwell and are actually excited about what the future may hold. No Malky, no problem. But as McClean's annoyance indicates, they are all too aware that this impending relegation should not have been allowed to happen. The frustration is that their squad is more than capable of challenging under the right guidance, but probably won't have the opportunity to do so. Wigan showed guts and dug in for Caldwell, whose more patient style in possession was referenced by the Latics' official Twitter account midway through this. It felt like a sly dig to his predecessor. Matt Smith scores Fulham's second goal to restore their lead against Wigan at Carven Cottage on Friday . Smith slides to his knees as he celebrates putting the home side back in front in the Championship match . And to come from behind twice shows qualities they just did not possess under Mackay. Caldwell, a rugged central defender, will be unhappy with the ease with which McCormack opened the scoring after just four minutes; Harry Maguire's header was a poor one, straight into the path of Sean Kavanagh, who fed the Scot and he was afforded the time to pick a spot and curl beyond Scott Carson. In a game lacking genuine chances, there were then two moments of real class. Firstly Jermaine Pennant levelled for Wigan, bending a wicked 25-yard free-kick away from the despairing Marcus Bettinelli. He ran the full length of the pitch to celebrate in front of the travelling hundreds. Wigan utility player James Perch (left) jumps for the ball and is challenged by Fulham's Sean Kavanagh (right) But anything the winger could do, lanky Smith would match. Fulham's target man - again in too much space - looked up from the same distance and marvellously clipped over Carson to net just his third goal for the club since a summer move from Leeds. Those flashes from the front two rather masked what was a disjointed display by the Cottagers, still smarting from their derby humiliation against Brentford last week. Fans were furious at Kit Symons' lack of tactical imagination, further compounded when Jason Pearce gambled at the back post to equalise for the visitors in the 69th minute. ______ The same when McCormack was hooked for defender Kostas Stafylidis. Much like against Brentford, Fulham's paying customers did not shirk away from telling him exactly what they thought. These are testing times for Symons, whose relationship with the fans is at its lowest ebb since he took over earlier this season. How he must've prayed Scott Parker didn't fluff his lines in stoppage time. Compare that to Wigan who, even though they will almost definitely join Blackpool in League One, are pulling in the same direction. Their new chairman David Sharpe, grandson of Dave Whelan, spoke of a long-term vision on appointing Caldwell on Tuesday, and that is something which has galvanised the place.

He wrote: 'Starting to bat tomorrow...might @periscopeco it, so all of you can watch it Live & see how I get on. Should I? £comeback'. Quite how Pietersen's '£comeback' will pan out in the long term is unclear. Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves advised that signing for a domestic side would help Pietersen's cause . Incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves has offered just enough encouragement for him to believe he could once again wear the Three Lions - despite a year of bitter recriminations and one dazzlingly indiscreet autobiography. His decision to hit the county trail, so long a bete noire in his career, at least offers the platform for him to nudge public opinion and the selectors from close quarters. But when England flew to the West Indies on Thursday ahead of the forthcoming Test series, the messages were thoroughly mixed. Controversial batsman Pietersen and current England coach Peter Moores have a fractious relationship . Captain Alastair Cook, who was not given a glittering write-up in Pietersen's book, largely absolved himself from the decision-making process, insisting it would be taken by Graves, managing director of England cricket Paul Downton and chief executive Tom Harrison.

Warm-up games can be low-key affairs but there cannot have been many times when an international side have been pitched against a team as bad as this. St Kitts were simply shambolic, so bad that Chigwell Cricket Club could give them a decent game, and an almost tragic example of the steep decline of Caribbean cricket. They were simply not fit for purpose. Jos Buttler appeals for a stumping as England dominated the second day of a farcical match in St Kitts . Mark Wood looked lively in his early spell after he was brought in for his first bowl for England . The statistics will say that England, having bowled St Kitts out for 59 on the first day of their opening two-day tour match, rattled up 379 for six declared with both Alastair Cook and Ian Bell retiring out. Then St Kitts, given just one session to hang on, capitulated again and finished on 76 for seven, narrowly avoiding handing England a hollow victory. The match was drawn, just about, and it should also have been hung and quartered. The modern fixture madness that will see England play 17 Tests in the next 10 months makes proper warm-ups almost impossible and is one of the main reasons why home teams nearly always win Test series these days. But when they are as meaningless as this it is questionable why it is even worth bothering. England may have spent time in the middle but they may as well have just turned up in Antigua next week to play the first of three Tests. Wood celebrates his first England wicket, but he is probably still a way off getting a first Test cap . Alastair Cook acknowledges the crowd after making a century, shortly before being retired out . Jos Battler had a short go at attacking the home bowlers before England declared with a mammoth 320 lead . For what it is worth, Bell and Joe Root made untroubled half-centuries yesterday after Cook had moved to his first century for England since the Ashes warm-up in Hobart 18 months ago and promptly retired. Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler then had a bit of a bash before England declared at the fall of Stokes just before tea, the small matter of 320 ahead. Then, in a move which further devalued the authenticity of the ‘contest,’ England brought Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood into the match for a work out. Wood, the Durham fast bowler, looked lively in his first bowl for England off his minimalist run-up and earned his first wicket when he bowled Shane Jeffers but it is unlikely to be enough to earn him a first Test cap just yet. ______ Yet at least they regained a semblance of pride by holding on as England gave their two spinners a decent bowl, Akeem Saunders and Leon Clarke doing most to keep England at bay. The only place in England’s first Test team yet to be decided, it seems, is between Adil Rashid and James Tredwell for the sole spinner’s slot and Tredwell was the clear winner here, taking three wickets to Rashid’s one. The Yorkshireman will need to have a very good second match to edge out Tredwell. James Tredwell (left) outperformed Adil Rashid in the contest to be England's Test spinner next week . Buttler makes an unconventional stop as England came close to winning the game in just two days . The only concern for England will be the form of Gary Ballance who looked out of touch before falling for 16, the legacy perhaps of a World Cup where he somehow became a symbol of England’s unimaginative one-day thinking. England’s desperate attempt to get as much as they can from the second of these two warm-ups will tomorrow see them bowl 90 overs at St Kitts whatever happens and then bat for 90 overs on Thursday. The first cricket score of 225 for 25 could be recorded at Warner Park tomorrow and the once proud reputation of Caribbean cricket will most likely take another hit.

176881,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l0,3686,0,0,"Instead of enjoying a conventional honeymoon after his wedding on Saturday Andy Murray will be heading to Barcelona next week for a training block that has now taken on a much increased significance. For in the wake of Amelie Mauresmo's announcement that she is pregnant, the world No 3's trial with his prospective assistant coach Jonas Bjorkman has assumed a greater importance. Mauresmo, who is to give birth some time in August, will be around eight months' pregnant during Wimbledon this summer, which is not finishing until July 12 due to the new three week gap between Roland Garros and The Championships. Andy Murray celebrates taking a set against Novak Djokovic in the final of the Miami Open . The British No 1 is set to marry his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears in Dunblane on Saturday . Therefore Bjorkman is likely to have a key part to play as Murray attempts to regain his title at SW19 – something which, given his improved form during the first part of the season and his prowess on grass, is well within his reach this year. Beyond that the 43 year-old Swede may also come into his own, as it is unclear how this will affect Mauresmo's 26 week per year commitment to the Scot, which is almost exclusively spent on the road. She also has the part-time job of being Captain of the French Fed Cup team, who are in action next weekend. Mauresmo has never made any secret of the fact that the travel is the part of the job that least appeals to her, and that will inevitably become more complicated with a baby on board. Already it must be very questionable whether she would be at the US Open which begins at the end of the August, although there has been no comment on this from either her or Murray, who has been up in Scotland ahead of tying the knot with Kim Sears in Dunblane. Murray's current coach Amelie Mauresmo has recently announced that she is expecting a baby . Mauresmo, pictured at this year's Australian Open, may have to alter her coaching schedule after the birth . ______ Murray has been planning to work with former world No 3 Jonas Bjorkman as an assistant coach . The Swede, pictured winning Wimbledon with Todd Woodbridge, is a former world No 1 doubles player . Last week in Miami Murray reported that the two of them had recently spent two hours on the phone together, and he has not been able to join up before because he has been involved with Sweden's version of Strictly Come Dancing. 'The time flew by,' the British No 1 said of their highly satisfactory conversation. It would be a major surprise if they somehow did not get along, or if he did not fit in with others in the team, including Mauresmo. Just where this leaves the player and his 35 year-old head coach will be for the two of them to work out. The softly-spoken Mauresmo is a very private person who prefers to keep a low profile on the tennis side of things, let alone on matters to do with her personal life. Bjorkman could have a key part to play in Murray's quest to reclaim the Wimbledon title he won in 2013 . She is known to have been accompanied by a girlfriend on trips with Murray to Australia and America this year, who stays in the background to the point where she has been near enough invisible. However pleased Murray will be for his coach on a personal basis – and there is no question they have become very close – he might also feel that the last thing he needs is any further complication or upheaval within his support team. His form has been good this year after all the disruptions and departures of last season, and Bjorkman appeared to be the last piece slotting into place. Now the Swede could find himself with a bigger role than was initially bargained for.","It is understood that the 27 year-old Scot has known about Mauresmo' s pregnancy for a number of weeks, but he was anyway planning on linking up with Bjorkman – the former world singles No 4 and doubles No 1 – prior to that. As Sportsmail reported as far back as nearly a year ago, the Swede was on Murray's shortlist to replace Ivan Lendl before he settled on the former Wimbledon women's champion as part of a groundbreaking move. A personable and intelligent man still actively involved in the game, and as someone who made the absolute best of his natural ability, he was someone the Scot identified as prime coaching material.","The sentence that has been most relevant to the subject is:

A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Masses of Australian cricketers, politicians and sportspeople penned heartfelt tributes on social media in the wake of his passing. Former Australian spin bowler Shane Warne called the champion leg spinner, the 'Godfather of cricket'. 'As a cricketer, commentator and as a person, you were the best there's ever been,' he wrote. Former captain Richie Benaud stands by a sculpture of himself at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2008 . Floral tributes gathered at the bronze statue of Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground .

He helped the Australian team have the attitude where they wanted to win. He played the game the right way. 'There's no doubt he's certainly going to be missed.' Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I grew up listening to Richie Benaud's wonderful cricket commentary. Like all fans of the sport, I will miss him very much.' Benaud was one of the world's most recognised commentators having initially started with the BBC in England before anchoring the Nine Network's cricket coverage in Australia for decades . Richie Benaud married his wife Daphne in July 1967 . A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators . Former Prime Minister John Howard greeted Richie Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground back in 2001 . Benaud was born in Penrith in western Sydney in October 1930. He enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer. As a player, Benaud appeared in 63 Test matches between 1951 and 1963, becoming the first man from any nation to score 2000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets . Penrith-born Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964 . 'When I was a kid we never ever wore a cap... because Keith Miller never wore a cap, ' Benaud said at the time. 'It's one of those things in life: you live and learn as you go along.' As captain he led Australia to four consecutive series victories, beginning with a 4-0 demolition of Peter May's 1958-59 tourists (Benaud took 31 wickets in the five tests). He never lost a series as captain.

The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal, cutting inside and curling left-footed past Simon Mignolet, in the 4-1 win over Liverpool last weekend, and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top-level full back. But, it seems, in the dressing room, it is his status as the club's premier sprinter, rather than as a defender, that is most in question, after he beat Theo Walcott's 40 metre club sprint record last summer. ______ Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season .

The Chelsea boss said in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph that the legendary Manchester United manager showed him 'two faces' during their first competitive meeting in 2004 - the first one of a steely rival and the second one of a sporting loser.

But when we beat United in the Champions League I got that beautiful face of a manager which I try to have myself. I try.' Mourinho has attracted controversy like no other manager in the modern game. His many spats with Wenger have seen him form a bitter rivalry with the Arsenal boss, with Mourinho's accusation in 2005 that the Frenchman is like 'a voyeur' perhaps being the moment their relationship hit an all-time low, from which it has never recovered.

The one possible exception is comedian James Corden, although he is busy working in America.

The lively Best then flashed a dangerous cross into the box which Bowery poked just over his own bar for a Brighton corner. At the right end, Bowery dragged an effort just wide of the mark before a good interception from Farrend Rawson stopped Best from getting in on goal. A good run from Rotherham full-back Jack Hunt resulted in a shot on goal as the Millers tried to make the points safe. Down the other flank Danny Lafferty laid on a big chance for Derbyshire to score his second but his shot on the angle was palmed away by Stockdale.

Despite their superb run, which has seen confidence grow after some 15 wins in the last 17 through all competitions, the title remains Chelsea's to lose, as the leaders currently hold a seven-point advantage and also a match in hand.

While some Gunners fans may have allowed themselves a little bit of fantasy football results over the run-in, which will see Chelsea come to the Emirates Stadium on April 26 and also play both Manchester United and Liverpool, Wenger remains very much focused on the job in hand. 'I have enough experience to know that I have to live with reality and reality is points and the next game,' he said. 'The dreams are for everybody - we all have dreams at night, but when I wake up in the morning I have to come here and make sure we give everything to win the next game.' Wenger continued: 'Chelsea have a difficult schedule, we have a difficult schedule, but what we can only do is master our own schedule. 'What we want is to go as high as we can until the end of the season, give our best and we are also in the semi-final of the FA Cup.

Spieth poses in his green jacket having held his nerve in Sunday's final round in a start-to-finish victory . 1 Depending on which part of the internet you believe, the name Spieth comes from Middle High German and means either 'successful' and 'speedy' or 'late'. 2 Recently started the Jordan Spieth Charitable Trust, which focuses on special needs youth, military families and junior golf. It is inspired by his younger sister Ellie, who has autism. 3 Even world No 1 Rory McIlroy was impressed by the course-record 63 Spieth produced to win the Australian Open in December. 'You could give me another 100 rounds today at the Australian and I wouldn't sniff 63,' McIlroy wrote on Twitter. 4 Spieth is an occasional member of the 'money games' organised by Phil Mickelson in practice rounds before tournaments. 5 Won the John Deere Classic two weeks before his 20th birthday in 2013, thereby becoming the first teenage winner on the PGA Tour since 1931. 6 Is only the second player after Tiger Woods to have won the US junior amateur championship more than once. 7 Spieth rented two houses at the Masters, one to sleep in and the other to hang out with friends and family. 8 He won two and a half points from his four matches at the Ryder Cup in Gleneagles last year, losing to Graeme McDowell in the singles after being three up with nine holes to play. 9 One of his mentors is fellow Texan Ben Crenshaw, who played his final round after 44 consecutive Masters appearances on Friday after Spieth had set a new 36-hole scoring record at Augusta National. 10 As a four-year-old Texas Rangers fan, Spieth attempted to catch a stray ball at a game, lost it in the lights and had his two front teeth knocked out. 'I plan on not taking it off for a while,' Spieth said after being presented with the green jacket by 2014 winner Bubba Watson. 'I'll probably sleep in it for a few nights. 'It's the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It's a dream come true for me. I did not break 70 last year even having a chance to win so to shoot some low scores and hear those roars is very special. 'To join the club that is the green jackets and to join Masters history and put my name on that trophy and to have this jacket forever, it's something that I can't fathom right now.

The Frenchman has thrived in the centre of Arsenal's midfield since returning from loan at Championship side Charlton earlier in the season to earn plaudits for his robust performances. Vieira was captain during Arsenal's trophy laden beginning to Arsene Wenger's reign and Coquelin hopes he can keep performing to emulate the club legend. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin, who has become an integral part of their midfield, celebrates with fans . 'I’m not going to say to you I am (the new Vieira), obviously I want to be but I think it’s down to the performance I put in every week so I’m just trying to give me best every game so hopefully I can do that in the long term,' Coquelin told BT Sport. On loan at Charlton, the 23-year-old feared he may not play for the Gunners again. 'Well, obviously that was in my head and I think at the time my loan had finished the first month. I could see the injuries over there, I think Arteta was out, Ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and I extended it and thought maybe I won’t get the chance now,' added Coquelin. The midfielder is determined to prove himself at Arsenal and hold down his place in the starting XI. The 23-year-old is not shy of putting in a robust challenge on opponents as he adds steel to Arsenal's midfield . 'I always had confidence in myself and belief in myself I just need the chance. I got the chance because other people got injured and tried to grab it with both hands and do as well as I could,' he told BT Sport. Arsenal have been much maligned in recent seasons for lacking grit and strength in the centre of the park, but Coquelin is happy to focus on the defensive side of the game. 'The way I think is that I’m just trying to do what’s best for the team. ______ But you need to think about the defensive aspect and that is what my job is all about.' Arsene Wenger's side have been in top form in the Premier League, winning their last six matches to close the gap on Manchester City in second and establish a place in the prestigious top four. The Gunners take on Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday in a pivotal clash in the race for Champions League football, but Arsenal's 'new Vieira' is confident. 'We obviously want to win this game you know, it’s a massive one, really important and we can increase the gap to nine points if we win so yes, I think it’s really important,' said the Frenchman. 'I can’t say definitely because mathematically it won’t be over, so I can’t say that, but yes we see a lot of confidence in us because over the last few months we have had some big results and if we can beat Liverpool it will be another massive one.' Coquelin celebrates with countryman Olivier Giroud as Arsenal managed to win every game in March .

Porto take a two-goal advantage to Munich next Tuesday for the return leg of the last-eight clash after punishing a sloppy Bayern with two early goals from Ricardo Quaresma and a second-half effort from Jackson Martinez. Guardiola said: 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries ... their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Pep Guardiola says his side suffered with the injuries they are currently contending with in the squad . Porto manager Julen Lopetegui said his side can now dream of reaching the semi-finals, but they will need to be 'perfect' in the second leg. 'Now we have produced a situation for ourselves where we can dream, knowing that we will need to give everything we have got to get through,' Lopetegui, a former Barcelona team mate of Guardiola, told reporters. 'We will need to produce a perfect performance in Germany next week to progress.' Julen Lopetegui says reaching the Champions League semi-final would be a dream come true . Ricardo Quaresma (7) gave Porto an early lead from the spot but Manuel Neuer was lucky to be on the pitch . Lopetegui said the return from injury of goalscorer Martinez, who had been out since early March with a hamstring problem, was one of the reasons for Wednesday's victory. 'With him back in the attack, we were able to press Bayern with some force and give them real problems,' he said. Martinez, who capitalised on an error by Jerome Boateng in the 65th minute to round Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer for Porto's third goal after Thiago Alcantara had reduced the arrears, said he was not yet 100 percent fit. The striker was a constant menace for Bayern's defenders and his tenacious harrying was rewarded after three minutes when he robbed Xabi Alonso before being brought down by Neuer for a penalty that Quaresma converted. Jackson Martinez (right) rounds Neuer to slot home Porto's third goal and put them in control . ______ 'It was fundamental that we tried our best to impose ourselves on Bayern and not give them a chance to settle,' Martinez said. Quaresma also sought to heap praise on Porto's team ethic, saying hard work had proved the difference between the two teams. 'There are no stars here. We all work hard for our results,' the forward said. 'The win is more important to us than the display.

The total paid out was £203,066, giving an average sum of £92.68. The biggest single payout was £5,463; the lowest £1. The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected, partly because of ‘the system failure of our customer complaint database’. It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated, saying: ‘It would create a precedent.’ Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved . This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time. Only one had got money back. Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham. They lost close to £1,500 on a trip to Morocco, where he had planned to propose, because their passports did not arrive in time – even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades. HM Passport Office made a surplus of £42.3 million between April and October last year.

Another hurdle on their way to the Premier League has been negotiated as they secured a hard-fought win over Reading. This was tense, though. Manager Eddie Howe would testify to that.

But, as of yet, the Cherries aren't choking, Callum Wilson's 22nd goal of the season setting them on their way to a third successive win at the Madejski Stadium. Howe said: ‘It was nervy, with what’s at stake it was always going to be that way. We defended for our lives and showed incredible mental strength. It was a different kind of win than we’re used to, but results are the most important things now. ‘I’d much rather we were playing total football and doing what we’ve done all season, but we are finding a new way to win and I’ll take that at this stage.’ There was no doubt over which team needed the three points more. This victory secured Bournemouth's position in the top-six, meaning - at the very least - that they'll have a crack at promotion via the play-offs. Reading, under Steve Clarke, have all but secured their Championship status, and with an FA Cup semi-final date at Wembley against Arsenal on the horizon the Royals, perhaps, had other matters on their mind. And so it proved as the Cherries took a fourth minute lead when Wilson fired home from close range after Andrew Surman's shot from the edge of the area struck Adam Federici's far post. It was exactly the start Howe wanted as they looked to maintain their position at the Championship summit. But the visitors had goalkeeper Artur Boruc to thank in the 17th minute as he produced an outstanding one-handed save to deny Jamie Mackie's close range effort from Jordan Obita's cross. And Nathaniel Chalobah, Hal Robson-Kanu and Obita all waste good opportunities to level for the Royals as they mustered a promising response to going behind. These were worrying moments for Howe, who paced regularly from the dugout to his technical area to holler instructions at his players. And despite Yann Kermogrant sending a towering header from Marc Pugh's cross narrowly wide during the dying seconds of the first-half, Bournemouth's early mojo had vanished.

The Royals defence made a mockery of trying to clear a Bournemouth throw deep inside their half, the ball eventually fell to Richie who let fly with a curling left-footed effort that skimmed the top of Federici's far post. Steve Cook then saw his half-volley from the edge of the area held by Federici as the visitors started to turn the screw.

Decades of cheap package holidays mean that thousands of retired people every year are paying with their health for sunburn they experienced in their youth. According to Cancer Research UK, men aged 65 and over are around ten times more likely to be diagnosed with malignant melanoma than those of their parents’ generation. Scroll down for video . Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows . And older women are about five times more likely to develop this disease than someone of the same age were in the mid-1970s. Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising.

Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person’s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest. Around 13,300 people across a wide range of ages are diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the UK each year making it the country’s fifth most common cancer overall and the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. And with sunbeds still very popular, the number of diagnoses is expected to rise to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800. ______ ‘Sun damage accumulates over time so avoiding sunburn - and sunbeds - is key, as well as getting to know your skin type so you don’t overdo it on the beach or even in the garden. ‘You can burn at home just as easily as you can on holiday, so remember to spend time in the shade, wear a T shirt and a hat to protect your skin and regularly apply sunscreen that is at least Factor 15 and has four stars. ‘Swapping bad sun habits for good ones could save your life.’ Sue Deans, a 69-year-old retired teacher and mother-of-three from Croydon, south London, who was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2000 after having a mole removed, said: ‘I was part of the generation where package holidays became affordable and you could go abroad nearly every year. ‘I don’t think there was much understanding at the time about the impact that too much sun can have on your risk of getting skin cancer. ‘And I loved the sun but suffered quite a bit of sunburn over the years. ‘I’ve always been quite body aware so my cancer was spotted early. ‘I had successful surgery and have been healthy since, but I’m always vigilant in keeping an eye out for anything unusual or persistent that might need to be checked. ‘Now I make sure my grandson knows the dangers of getting caught out in the sun.’","Professor Richard Marais, Cancer Research UK’s skin cancer expert: ‘It’s worrying to see melanoma rates increasing at such a fast pace, and across all age groups. ‘It’s very important for people to take care of their skin in the sun. ‘It’s also important for them to keep an eye on their skin and seek medical opinion if they see any changes to their moles, or even to normal areas of skin. ‘Melanoma is often detected on men’s backs and women’s legs but can appear on any part of the body.’ Each year, 2,100 Britons die from the disease.

Soon after that, Crawford was a two-time WBO champion, winning the latest title in his first fight since moving up in class. Crawford won the vacant WBO junior welterweight title with a sixth-round technical knockout Saturday night, knocking down Dulorme three times in quick fashion after that big blow. Terence Crawford (right) defeated Thomas Dulmorme in the sixth round with a technical knock out . ______ 'I knew he was hurt real bad. I wanted to just jump on him. ... He was woozy.' With Dulorme stunned, Crawford hit him again and knocked him down for the first time. Then Crawford delivered a flurry of punches, leading to another knockdown. When Dulorme got back up, Crawford unloaded again - and the fight was stopped as Dulorme staggered against the ropes near his corner. 'Basically a shot that I didn't see, and the shot got me,' Dulorme said through an interpreter. Crawford remained undefeated, winning as a heavy favorite in his first fight moving in the 140-pound class. He won the WBO lightweight title 13 months ago and defended in the 135-pound division twice in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. The scheduled 12-round fight in North Texas came a week before Crawford, now 26-0 with 18 knockouts, is scheduled to be in New York to accept his 2014 fighter of the year award from the Boxing Writers Association of America. The fighter celebrates after winning the vacant WBO world junior welterweight title . After the fight ended, promoter Bob Arum shouted 'That's why he's the fighter of the year!' Dulorme, the 27-year-old Puerto Rican, is 22-2. He had won his last six bouts since moving down in class after being knocked out by Luis Carlos Abregu at 147 pounds in a welterweight fight in October 2012. 'It was a great opportunity for us,' Dulorme said. 'It wasn't the best night. We were winning in the cards, it's something that basically happened. ... We did the fight that we came here to do.' Crawford seemed measured in his approach the first two rounds against the quick-starting Dulorme, who entered the ring wearing a gladiator helmet and breastplate. Dulorme was clearly the aggressor early against Crawford, who went with a red Nebraska Cornhuskers cap for his entry. Crawford dominated the fight throughout and Dulmorne couldn't handle his speed and punching power . But in round 3, there was a quick exchange of punches, and later a hard body blow by Crawford. There were times in the fourth and fifth rounds when Crawford either smiled or shook his head after taking blows from Dulorme. Crawford taunted him, and at the end of the fourth had him back into a corner and delivered two big rights. Crawford was also smiling at the end of the fifth round, then came out in the sixth and ended the fight. 'Just having fun with it,' he said. 'When I'm having fun, I don't think nobody can beat me because that means I'm in my rhythm.' Crawford knocks down the Puerto Rican following a combination of punches in the sixth round . Crawford's trainer, Brian McIntyre, said the first couple of rounds were just a matter of Crawford getting his timing down. McIntyre said they knew the punching Dulorme would wear out, though he lasted longer than they expected. Arum this week called Crawford a new superstar on the horizon, and said this fight a 'very, very crucial first step' for Crawford to join the truly elite group of fighters. Arum was at the bout halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth that came only two weeks before the long-awaited fight in Las Vegas between another of his boxers, Manny Pacquiao, and Floyd Mayweather Jr. Dulmore was unable to recover from his knockdown and the referee stopped the fight . In an earlier eight-round lightweight matchup of previously unbeaten fighters, Ismail Muwendo from Minneapolis improved to 17-0 with a majority decision over Rolando Chinea from Lancaster, Pennsylvania. One judge had the fight as a draw, while the others had it in favor of Muwendo. Chinea dropped to 10-1-1. Benjamin 'The Blaxican' Whitaker from San Antonio improved to 9-1 as a pro with a unanimous decision over Skender Halili, a boxer from nearby Fort Worth whose had won each of his previous eight professional fights by knockout.

64755,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,1350,1,0,"With 20 goals to his name this season, Watford captain Troy Deeney is regarded by many as the best striker outside the Premier League. In fact, Deeney has been lighting up the Championship for the last three seasons, scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game. The next logical step for the Birmingham-born striker is the top flight and, with Watford just a point off the top of the table with five games to go, he could well be skippering the Hornets in the Premier League next season. Watford striker Troy Deeney won the Championship's Player of the Month award for March . Hornets skipper Deeney is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading Watford to the Premier League . Deeney believes he can follow in the path of Charlie Austin and Danny Ings  by becoming a Premier League hit . Watford are currently just one point behind Championship leaders Bournemouth with five games left to play . And Deeney, who was this week named the Sky Bet Championship player of the month for March, makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level. He said: 'I've looked at Charlie Austin, Danny Ings, Rickie Lambert and Grant Holt before that. 'These are all people that have been in the Championship, done well, then held their own in the Premier League. 'There is a sign there that you can really go on (from the Championship). If you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals. 'I want to make sure that when I go up there I'm ready for it and I show what I'm about.' It seems fair for Deeney to say 'when' and not 'if' he plays at the top level because on this season's evidence he and striker partner Odion Ighalo certainly are ready for it. Between them the Championship's most lethal strikeforce have scored 39 league goals this season and Deeney waxed lyrical about his Nigerian strike partner. 'He's a natural finisher,' he said. 'Before Saturday (when Ighalo scored from 20 yards in the win over Middlesbrough) we had been joking that all of his goals were inside the 18-yard box. 'He's definitely a poacher and when he scores he normally scores doubles, one game he got four. ______ 'I think you have to be very ruthless in the Premier League and we've shown that we can score goals. 'Are we confident we can do it? Definitely.' Watford - currently third in the table and kept out of the top two only on goal difference - joined the promotion-chasing pack late after a turbulent start to the season saw three managers depart before current boss Slavisa Jokanovic took charge in October. But referring to that period Deeney, who has played under seven managers since joining Watford from Walsall in 2010, insists: 'It wasn't that bad.' He added: 'It definitely brought the players closer together. 'It's just one of those things really, in any line of work if your manager changes your job doesn't change.' Watford have won 15 of Jokanovic's 27 matches in charge and Deeney has been impressed by the Serbian's tactical flexibility. Ahead of Saturday's trip to Millwall, he said: 'We've got a talented squad so we can go from 4-4-2 to 4-4-2 diamond to 3-5-2 or 4-3-3. 'His (Jokanovic's) adaptability would be the one thing that makes him stand out.' Former Watford boss Beppe Sannino handed Deeney the captain's armband during his brief spell in charge . But Deeney's role in the revival of Watford's season, not just as goalscorer but as captain, cannot be underestimated. Beppe Sannino made him captain before the start of the season and Deeney seems to have taken to the role like a duck to water. 'I was very vocal anyway,' he said. 'If I've got something to say I'm going to say it anyway, good or bad, and I think that once people know me they respect that. 'If you're doing good I'll tell you you're doing good, if you're doing wrong I'll tell you you're doing wrong. I don't expect anything else of others towards myself. 'The added responsibility of now having to lead even more by example, I think that's the only that's changed. 'But then I think I did it pretty well beforehand, I think that's why they made me captain. They know what I'm about and what I offer. 'But now it's a case of justifying why they have made that decision.' Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and says it is no coincidence he has enjoyed by far the best three seasons of his career since his release. Deeney has warned his Watford team-mates they have 'three weeks of hard work' ahead of them . 'The two are definitely linked,' he admits. 'But it's more down to personal growth and realising what an opportunity I had, instead of being an idiot and just letting my chance go by. 'I've just grasped it with both hands and become a better footballer and a better person for it, so it (prison) was probably a blessing in disguise.' Captaining Watford in the Premier League next season, Deeney admits, would be the crowning glory after three years' hard work following his release. 'That would be the fairytale ending,' said the 26-year-old. 'But we've got three weeks of hard work before we can even start thinking about that, so I'm just going to keep working and hopefully that fairytale can come true.' You get the feeling Deeney will be playing in the Premier League regardless of what happens in the next few weeks. But  Watford have as good a chance as any of promotion with their talismanic captain in the side.","He scores in bunches which is a sign of a real good striker.' Deeney is adamant that together he and Ighalo could terrorise Premier League defences. 'I've been and watched a few games this season and I don't see why not,' he said. Watford striker Odion Ighalo has also been in fine goalscoring form during the course of the campaign . Deeney has been impressed with Slavisa Jokanovic since the Watford manager took charge in October .","The blank denoted by ""__________"", represents Chris Mh Deng's name.

Former Celtic star Hooper's goal sparked jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench in contrast to the dejection of his one-time Parkhead boss Neil Lennon. Indeed, Hooper had been a transfer target for Lennon earlier in the season so his winning goal was a double blow for the Ulsterman. Gary Hooper celebrates after earning Norwich three points with a stoppage-time winner against Bolton . Former Celtic striker Hooper is mobbed by his team-mates as Norwich remained second in the Championship .

Graham Dorrans gave the Canaries an early lead as his right-footed free-kick deflected off Josh Vela into the net, but Adam Le Fondre looked to have rescued a point and extended Bolton's unbeaten run to four games. Instead, Hooper lobbed keeper Adam Bogdan - as the Wanderers defenders switched off - to score an invaluable goal. Lennon had promised his side would spoil a few parties in the remaining games of the season with Brantford and Bournemouth coming up in the next few weeks. That looked to be the case until Hooper's strike made it five wins in the last six meetings between the teams. Norwich made the perfect start with Dorrans' deflected free-kick after Vela took down Nathan Redmond on the edge of the area. The Canaries should have doubled their advantage six minutes later as Sebastien Bassong rose highest at a corner but cleared Bogdan's crossbar by some distance. Hooper lobs the ball over Adam Bogdan to spark jubilant scenes on the Canaries bench . Former West Brom midfielder Graham DOrrans celebrates after giving the visitors the lead on Saturday . ______ It was so one-sided manager Lennon was poised to bring on Neil Danns to shore up his midfield. Instead, youngster Tom Walker, who had been guilty of delaying a cross moments earlier, learned his lesson. His flashing centre from the left picked out Le Fondre inside the six-yard box and the on-loan Cardiff City striker, back in the side after missing the Easter Monday trip to South Wales, finished with ease. Walker continued to prove a threat to the visitors' defence with his elusive running and was harshly booked for a foul on Wes Hoolahan. Liam Feeney shot narrowly wide from another Walker cross that fizzed beyond three static Norwich defenders before the Canaries rediscovered their composure. Top scorer Cameron Jerome, whose double won the reverse fixture at Carrow Road last October, brought a smart save out of Bogdan while the Hungarian international needed treatment after punching away another dangerous-looking Dorrans free-kick. Norwich striker Cameron Jerome heads towards goal during the clash at the Macron Stadium . The second half was much more competitive and Wanderers were more of a match for their high flying visitors. So much so that Neil brought on Lewis Grabban after 57 minutes for Hoolahan. And Grabban made an immediate impact, bringing out a save from Bogdan before Tim Ream cleared off the line from first-half scorer Dorrans. However, Bolton had their moments going forward too with Le Fondre trying cheekily to chip John Ruddy while Alex Tettey cleared off the line after Dorian Dervite narrowly failed to connect with Walker's corner. Neil's intention's were clear and with 20 minutes left had made his full set of substitutions with Hooper replacing Nathan Redmond and Steven Whittaker going off for Ryan Bennett.

Cristiano Ronaldo, winner of the Ballon d'Or on three occasions, is presented with last year's award . Lionel Messi, who finished runner-up to Ronaldo in 2014, has previously won the compeition three times . Speaking last year, Wenger said he was ‘totally against’ the Ballon d’Or, and in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph, Mourinho moved to side with his great Premier League rival. ‘I think Wenger said something that is interesting; he is against the Ballon d’Or, and I think he’s right, because in this moment football is losing a little bit the concept of the team to focus more on the individual,’ said Mourinho. ‘We are always looking at the individual performance, the individual stat, the player that runs more. Because you run 11km in a game and I run nine you did a better job than I did? Maybe not! Maybe my 9km were more important than your 11.’ Arsene Wenger and Mourinho have clashed on a number of occasions during their managerial careers . Eden Hazard is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring in their victory against Stoke City . Ronaldo beat Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer, of Bayern Munich, to this year’s award which was presented to the former Manchester United star in December. It is the third time he has been honoured with the gong. The second of his triumphs came when he was playing under Mourinho at Madrid. ‘For me, football is collective,' added Mourinho, whose Chelsea team travel to Loftus Road on Sunday as they bid to be crowned Premier League champions. ______ No, no, you are coming now to help us be better.

But that doesn’t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid  a stroke. Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera, Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage.

The Irons looked to have done enough to battle to victory after taking an early lead through a superb free-kick by full back Aaron Cresswell. However, after seeing two efforts from Marko Arnautovic ruled out for offside and a header by substitute Mame Diouf hit the post, the visitors snatched a deserved point five minutes into stoppage time when the Austrian winger crashed the ball into the far corner.

West Ham remain in top 10 despite their late slip-up . West Ham remain in the top 10, but Allardyce knows their position should have been much more comfortable after witnessing yet another late capitulation from a positive position.

'It was not about us playing well or not, it was about winning and we had got ourselves into a fantastic position . 'When you are less than 30 seconds away from winning the game and you don't, that is the ultimate blow. 'We are very nervous on that stage based on what happened before. ______ Allardyce added: 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. 'Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' Allardyce is out of contract in the summer, with the club's owners yet to decide in which direction they want to take West Ham ahead of their move to the Olympic Stadium. The 60-year-old, though, intends to remain professional in his approach over the final matches of a campaign which had earlier promised so much. 'It depends on what you say. Do you say what is the overall season like? It should be 50 points, it should be very, very good. It is small margins of victories to draws and draws to defeat,' Allardyce added. 'In the judgement at the end of the season, or if not what happens before that, then we talk about what we are doing going forwards.

Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool’s offer of close to £100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £40million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with £40million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo — Gareth Bale even — requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool’s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike Tottenham’s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player’s agent for his role in the England international’s ongoing contract saga — and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers’ criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as ‘Uncle Aidy’. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has ‘more kids than caps’ when he admits to one daughter — he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training — but denies a second child. But Sterling’s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. ‘As a young kid I had anger issues,’ Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up ‘in prison’ if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was ‘amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker’. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. ______ Gallen also praised Sterling’s mother — Nadine is a nurse — for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his ‘house parents’. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling’s value to Liverpool is earning roughly £6m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; £35,000-a-week compared with £150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling’s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of £100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club’s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song ‘from the Kop’. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his ‘agent is a ****’. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don’t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don’t take the dispute into the public arena if it’s not a pay rise you’re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward’s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a ‘beautiful house’ back in Jamaica. Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?","Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling’s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose ‘mentality’ was ‘his strongest attribute’. He also described him as ‘a coach’s dream’.","It's difficult to tell with a blunt statement like that, but you could fill in the blank with ""get a degree"".",0.8261172175,0.8282082677,0.8271614313,0.1176470588,0.0,0.1176470588,0.1176470588

The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer . Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. ______ 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

For the first time the Enstone-based marque are providing their test and reserve driver with a number of outings in Friday's first practice session ahead of grand prix weekends. Ordinarily in the past, Lotus' reserve has been nothing more than a spare part, stood on the sidelines whilst the race drivers completed their tasks. Jolyon Palmer will drive in every Friday practice session for Lotus this season . ______ That's the aim,' said Palmer. 'I'm pretty much running on the same run plan as those guys. It's not like we've seen in FP1 sessions before with other drivers where they have been on quali settings, engine turned up or low fuel. 'This year there's a direct comparison and I want to show why I should be racing next year.'

Palmer drives  during practice for the Chinese Grand Prix last weekend . The 24-year-old from Horsham would love to be keeping his hand in, but knows it is something he has to sacrifice to keep his F1 dream alive. 'I want to race, but only if I get the right offer,' added Palmer, son of former F1 driver Jonathan. 'If I get a good offer to do something that would be a good career move for me then I'd like to race. 'It's about keeping sharp. It's the one thing I'm missing this year. 'I'm loving working with Lotus and being in F1, but I'd love to be racing as well, so if I get a good offer I'd love to.' Palmer, though, is not actively seeking further employment because of his commitment to Lotus, adding: 'My main focus is all here and I'm really busy anyway. 'If something came my way then I would definitely consider it, but my main priority is Lotus and I will not compromise anything I do here by racing elsewhere. 'But if there is something that came along that could fit in with this then I'd be happy to do it.'","This year, however, Lotus have decided Palmer will get a shot, and not just as a driver doing all the donkey work too. Every Friday Palmer will be behind the wheel - as was the case in China last week and again in Bahrain this week - his run-plan will be similar to that of whoever he replaces. In China, Palmer was only 0.6secs behind Pastor Maldonado at the end of FP1, a tremendous effort given it was Palmer's first major outing at an F1 event.

That is backed up by his statistics since January 1 as he has scored 11 in 16 matches. Martinez believes he would have a difficult time trying to convince striker Lukaku to take it easy . ______ 'I think there have been two clear different periods,' added Martinez. 'Coming back from the World Cup was a really tough moment from a physical point of view to get back to his best level. 'We worked really hard to get him back to the level and from the last week of December there was a real change for someone like him who relies on his physical capability. 'I thought he hit the best level and from that point on we have seen a completely different Romelu: someone who was in control of his movements and then the power and pace was very effective. 'He has always been a clinical goalscorer and I think his level has generally been quite impressive.' In four Europa League ties in the knockout stage Lukaku scored seven times, including a hat-trick against Young Boys in Switzerland.

Footage this week emerged showing the Liverpool forward inhaling nitrous oxide, a legal high commonly known as laughing gas because it creates feelings of euphoria . But Sherwood said: ‘Let's hope he's not laughing after Sunday.’ Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood is hoping they can cause a FA Cup semi-final shock vs Liverpool on Sunday . Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . The Aston Villa manager knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham Hotpur’s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sterling has been pictured smoking shisha pipes as well as taking so-called ‘hippy crack’ through a balloon. Sherwood said that was wrong but added: ‘I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn’t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.’ Sherwood can remember being wowed by a 14-year-old Sterling on the books at Queens Park Rangers, but was unable to convince Spurs to commit the money required to sign him. Instead, Sterling headed to Anfield for £600,000 in 2010. ‘A lot of academies pick players on size because the bigger kids normally push the little kids over and their teams can win the games,’ said Sherwood. ‘He wouldn’t be much different from what he is now but you wouldn’t want to fight him would you?’ Sherwood has been a fan of Liverpool starlet Sterling (left) ever since he was 14 and on the books at QPR . Another Liverpool player Sherwood discussed on Friday was Steven Gerrard, whose birthday falls on the FA Cup final on May 30. Those associated with the Merseyside club feel an ideal silverware send-off is brewing before Gerrard heads to LA Galaxy. ‘Believe it or not it’s not about spoiling the party for Steven Gerrard,’ insisted Sherwood. ‘It’s about what we can do. To be honest we’re hoping he’s on his holiday in May.’ Sherwood played against a teenage Gerrard in his latter days and hailed the 34-year-old’s clear talent from the off. He added: ‘I’m sure Steven could still do a job for a Premier League side but I’m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than Liverpool. ______ Liverpool have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for the FA Cup semi after serving a three-match ban . The match could be Gerrard's (left) last in the competition before his move to LA Galaxy in the summer . Sherwood believes Villa can upset favourites Liverpool. ‘It’s a very exciting game, a great opportunity for this club to get to an FA Cup final,’ he said. ‘I’ve lost a few semi-finals myself, not a great feeling. ‘We’re going in with a positive state of mind. This club’s relegation is not at stake, it is about us maybe getting some glory for the football club. ‘We have the mindset to win the game, impose ourselves on a very good Liverpool side, that’s what we intend to do. ‘We think we’re capable, we have a good blend of players who can play and maybe go direct at time. We’re prepared to mix it up, we have a plan.’ Despite the possible return of Gerrard, Sherwood is confident his Villa side can cause a shock at Wembley .","He can earn £1 a week or £200,000, he’ll still play the same way. That’s a dying breed – there aren’t many of them about.’ Sherwood has led a Villa resurgence since taking over in February, steering the club away from relegation danger and into this Wembley showpiece.

Michael Jacobs' ninth-minute opener looked to have given the bottom-of-the-table Seasiders their first success on the road since they beat Wanderers' neighbours Wigan on April 26. But Bolton, who have repeatedly conceded late goals themselves in recent weeks, mustered an equaliser in the fifth minute of stoppage time when Emile Heskey, Neil Danns and Gudjohnsen combined to leave the visitors crestfallen.

Bolton Wanderers' Josh Vela and Blackpool's Jamie O'Hara (right) vie for the ball . Tangerines stopper Joe Lewis made a couple of smart stops to deny winger Liam Feeney and centre-back McCarthy but there was a malaise about Bolton's play which Neil Lennon had been so keen to avoid pre-match. In the second half, Amos failed to clear a corner and Clarke leant back and skewed his effort over the top before Jacobs cut in from the left flank and bent a brilliant effort just wide. Lewis had been largely untroubled apart from a routine save from Tom Walker but he was stranded at the other end of his goal when Adam Le Fondre cut the ball across for an onrushing Barry Bannan, who somehow placed his side-footed strike against the outside of the post. Lennon had started with just one striker but introduced three off the bench by bringing on Heskey, Craig Davies and Gudjohnsen. The hosts' chance looked to have gone when Lewis stopped McCarthy's header and O'Hara scrambled Mills' try off the line but there was still time for a dramatic finale. Heskey looked certain to nod Bannan's back-post cross in but when he could not connect, the ball came back out to Danns, whose volley was helped in by Gudjohnsen on the line, with Blackpool fuming about an offside flag which never came.","It was at this very venue that Blackpool boss Lee Clark pulled off a great escape on the final day of last season at the helm of Birmingham, who scored in the third minute of stoppage time to prevent relegation into the third tier, but this time he was on the wrong end of some late drama. In recent weeks Clark had publicly accepted the Seasiders, who remain 16 points from safety, were doomed but Rotherham's defeat to Blues 24 hours earlier meant they kicked off knowing they would not be relegated at the Macron Stadium. That may have instilled a freedom to Clark's troops and the home crowd were stunned into silence by Jacobs' early opener. He collected a long, direct ball down the right, turned on the afterburners to accelerate away from Josh Vela and Paddy McCarthy and lashed beyond Ben Amos in the Bolton goal.

Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . ______ Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.","Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass.

Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body’s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England’s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just ‘too accident prone’. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . ______ ‘The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,’ said Harrison in an ECB statement. ‘The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.’ Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today’s board meeting at Lord’s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. ‘This doesn’t impact on Peter Moores’ position at all,’ Harrison said later on Sky. ‘This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.’ Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing .

She is also co-chairman of Reading Football Club with Madejski. Lady Sasima Srivikorn is in her 70s with an endearing laugh and a royal blue scarf she has knitted especially for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal at Wembley. Like 73-year-old Madejski, Lady Sasima is something of an eccentric. Educated at London's Guildhall School of Music and Drama in the 1950s, she has been a singer and composer who wrote the theme song for the Asian Games. 'It was called Reach For The Stars,' she says proudly before talking enthusiastically about her involvement with the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra and her autobiography, A Life By Chance. Reading co-owners Lady Sasima Srivikorn and Sir John Madejski spoke to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton . The Championship club will swap the Madejski Stadium for Wembley on Saturday in the FA Cup semi-final . But then she offers a chilling insight into what it is to be one of Thailand's most powerful women, a super-rich Harvard Business School graduate who became the first female on the Thai Airways board. Madejski listens intently as the woman he credits with rescuing Reading last September talks about the night in 2014 when three men armed with M16 automatic weapons fired on her house in north-east Thailand. She believes the incident was provoked by the political activities of her daughter and son-in-law. The previous day they had instigated a peaceful public demonstration after seeing the former wife of Thaksin Shinawatra — ex-Thai prime minister and one-time owner of Manchester City — in a Bangkok shopping mall. Shinawatra was removed from power in 2006 in a military coup after allegations of corruption. Jamie Mackie celebrates after scoring Reading's third goal against Bradford to secure their victory . Reading beat Bradford 3-0 in a quarter-final reply at the Madejski to secure their Wembley semi-final . Lady Sasima says her daughter was still angry about the corruption, explaining: 'The next day I am with friends at my house. We had been playing cards until about 2am. We had just gone to bed. And I had 100 bullets from an M16 shot at my house. 'They didn't mean to kill. They just wanted to scare, to threaten, but bullets hit my bathroom. The windows in my bedroom.' Presumably she now goes everywhere under armed guard? 'No,' she says. 'There's no use having security. If someone really wants to kill me, they can kill me any time. It's funny, when I realised it was a machine gun I thought it was the moment when I was about to die but I was very calm, not frightened at all.' 'This is one hell of a wise lady — and very modest too,' says Madejski admiringly. When I first saw Lady Sasima at the hotel at the Madejski Stadium, she was seated at the head of a table having breakfast with five Thai gentlemen. One was Pairoj Piempongsant, who brokered the deal when Shinawatra bought City in 2007 and is now senior adviser to the four-strong Thai consortium that purchased Reading last year. 'In business I'm probably more comfortable with men. I find them more straight-forward,' she explains now she is in the Lady Sasima Suite that boasts a perfect view of the pitch. Reading players mob goalscorer Garath McCleary during their 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final win over Bradford . Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives the lowdown on Reading's players to watch ahead of the Arsenal match . 'The people you saw me having breakfast with are involved in politics. And you may have recognised Pairoj Piempongsant. He is a very nice man who has the knowledge and contacts we need.' As the owner of a 25 per cent stake in Reading, Lady Sasima is clearly not about to let Piempongsant run the show, however. 'I started in business when I was 25,' she says. 'My late husband's parents passed away and we had some money. We started with a school — which one of my daughters now runs — and then we had a hotel — but my biggest passion is land. I like real estate. I like to create things. It allows me to use my imagination.' She appears to be thinking along these lines with Reading. The consortium has already invested heavily in the club's academy, building 13 pitches. She says she is also in discussion with Reading Council and talks of a vision of 'a second London' along the M4 corridor. 'I love this town,' she says. For Reading FC the longer-term vision is clear. A club that has twice before been promoted to the Barclays Premier League want to return under manager Steve Clarke. 'That is the ambition,' she says and Madejski nods in agreement. Arsenal, pictured in training on Friday, will provide a tough test for Steve Clarke's Reading on Saturday . Madejski and Lady Sasima pose for a photo at the Madejski Stadium during their chat with Sportsmail . Madejski sees the Thai consortium as Reading's saviours, given the financial difficulties the club endured after selling to Anton Zingarevich. The cash the Russian was expected to invest when he bought Reading in 2012 never materialised and after a period Madejski described as the 'most stressful of my life', Lady Sasima and her colleagues stepped in. 'They have been like a breath of fresh air. I can't tell you how excited I am about the future,' he says. By his own admission Madejski needed to sell. He did a remarkable job with his hometown club, building the stadium as well as overseeing their rise to the top flight for the first time. But reports have suggested he lost the best part of £300million between 2008 and 2014 and he does not deny it. 'I'm not sure it was quite that much,' he says, 'but I lost a heck of a lot of dosh.' 'Not on football?' Lady Sasima asks, a little nervously. 'No, no,' says Madejski, with a laugh. 'An entrepreneur's life is cyclical. I'm just pleased we can now look forward in a positive way.' Reading man Hal Robson-Kanu battles with Bournemouth's Andrew Surman in the Royals' last game . Lady Sasima and Madejski are excited about Saturday and have a long-term ambition to get to the top flight . When it comes to Saturday evening's match, Reading's first FA Cup semi-final since 1927, this pair of septuagenarians — possibly the oddest couple in sport — are giddy with excitement. Lady Sasima talks of the 'honour' of playing Arsenal and the thrill of taking family, friends and business associates to Wembley. ______ In 12 previous attempts they have never beaten Arsenal. Madejski talks movingly about being in foster care after his mother was ostracised by her family for a wartime fling that led to his arrival. 'Being illegitimate wasn't the most ennobling start,' he says. 'I feel sorry for my mother. She never really got over the fact of me. The pair are desperate to take their club back to the promised land of the Premier League . Reading boss Clarke has a tough test to come through on Saturday when his side face Arsenal at Wembley . 'I found out who my father was only 10 years ago. I never met him but his name was William Adshead. Quite ironic really when you think I became an ""ads head"" with the Auto Trader business. He was from Liverpool which is probably why I get on well with Cilla Black.' Now Lady Sasima is the one listening intently. 'I didn't know Sir John's story until after we bought the club,' she says, 'but he is a real gentleman. When my sons heard about me buying Reading they were all shocked. The first question they asked me was ""where is your business model?"" 'I said there isn't one. I don't think there can be in football. You just have to be passionate, dedicated and perhaps lucky. 'Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Everyone asks why? Why football? Why now? But you have this team that wins and loses. It's woken me up. Made me feel more alert.' Madejski gives her a squeeze. 'And it's fun,' he says.","A man who has been defined by triumph over adversity, Madejski loves the fact that his team are underdogs.","Lady Sasima Srivikorn of Reading FC is one of the most powerful women in Thailand, who rose from being a singer and composer to becoming the first female member of the Thai Airways board.",0.8269270658,0.8430482149,0.8349097967,0.1132075472,0.0,0.0754716981,0.0754716981

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches, after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ‘reckless’ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion, as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27. Hughes was shown a red card for the offence, but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded. Although it was accepted that there had been no intent, the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing. Yet, in a stunning twist – and in light of fierce criticism – the ban was thrown out, as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held. Nathan Hughes's knee collided with George North's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton . North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months . Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday . North was left unconscious by the clash; a third blow to the head in the space of two months. He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing, to counter-act his concussion symptoms. ______ Hughes missed his club’s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday, as he awaited his appeal hearing. He is now free to return to action immediately, but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps’ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture, he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26. Jeremy Summers, chairman of the appeal hearing panel, said: ‘The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh. Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel, it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally.’","Graphic, slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin’s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes, but many more spoke up in his defence. Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended – and their dismay was shared by others outside the club. Captain James Haskell said: ‘Astounded would be an under-statement’, while fly-half Andy Goode added: ‘Really can’t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes. There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome.’ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a ‘total joke’ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment, calling it an ‘absolute joke’. Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 .","Nathan Hughes sits on Friday night pleased and potentially credited for his appeal win, as the ban was rescinded.",0.8445331454,0.8019075394,0.8226685524,0.125,0.0281690141,0.0833333333,0.0833333333

Flintoff, speaking at the England and Wales Cricket Board's NatWest T20 launch, sees a bright summer and lasting future ahead for 'probably the premier tournament' in this country. The dual Ashes-winning all-rounder is less convinced, however, about Pietersen's prospects of forcing his way back into Test contention. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 for Surrey in The Parks as he bids to earn a recall to the England squad . Former England star Andrew Flintoff thiks time is running out for Pietersen to resurrect his England career . Pietersen already has three Ashes series wins on his CV but will be 35 before the 2015 edition begins, and Flintoff senses he no longer has age on his side. The controversial record-breaking batsman has been surplus to requirements since being sacked 14 months ago after Alastair Cook's team were whitewashed 5-0 in Australia, but has taken heart from incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves' hints that there may be a way back after all. Pietersen and his agent have both spoken of the 'clean slate' being presented to him, and he began restating his case by hitting 170 against MCCU Oxford in his first red-ball innings for Surrey since June 2013. Flintoff is concerned nonetheless that there is simply no vacancy for Pietersen. 'He's a fantastic player, but nobody just walks into any team - especially the England team, 'I'm back, I'm here, I'm playing',' Flintoff told Press Association Sport. England have won their last three Tests under Cook, pre-dating a miserable World Cup, and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the West Indies. Pietersen has not featured for England since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . It is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside, on current form. 'Which of them do you say ""you're not playing!"" for Kevin to come in?' Flintoff said. 'I just think Kevin is running out of time a little bit. 'If he'd started the season last year with Surrey, and scored run after run and put himself in the position... whereas now I think he's looking at the Ashes and he's just running out of time. 'That's not to say he (definitely) won't feature, but I can't imagine it's going to be in the near future.' Flintoff is optimistic about England's fortunes, despite their winter woes, with or without Pietersen. 'Alastair Cook is so important, and you get the sense everyone within the England set-up wants him as captain,' he said. 'He's a popular lad, and a great player. 'Peter Moores, there aren't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke.' ______ 'In Australia, you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants Australia to do well. 'With England, I've never had a sense of that. 'It's about time we started talking them up. I think it's time we started supporting the side, getting behind Cook, Moores, the players. 'It's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who hasn't moved his feet. (I think) maybe we should be a bit better than that, and start celebrating the lads a bit.' He is enthusiastic too about this summer's T20 Blast, insisting it is no poor relation of the Indian Premier League - or the Big Bash, in which he played last winter for Brisbane Heat. Flintoff says Alastair Cook is so important to England despite poor showing in the first Test against West indies . Flintoff said: 'The competition gets stronger. It's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now, with the crowds and excitement behind it. 'We're seeing that, with some of the players coming over - the world's best, Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum, (Glenn) Maxwell, (Aaron) Finch. 'I played in the Big Bash, and the standard was high (but) this stands up as a competition. 'You turn up at Old Trafford for Lancashire-Yorkshire, and get 25,000 people, then to Chelmsford where they're playing in front of packed houses - so I don't subscribe to that. 'Anything in this country, we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there. 'We don't really focus on what we've got. Flintoff shares a joke with players at the Natwest T20 Blast launch at Edgbaston on Thursday . 'I didn't see anything within the Big Bash and thought 'this is far better than what we've got at home'.' Whether at 37 he will be a part of the Blast again, after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping Lancashire to win the tournament last summer, is another matter. 'I'm not arrogant enough to think I can just walk into the Lancashire dressing-room and say 'I'm back, I'm playing',' he added. 'The one reason I wanted to play (last year) is because I love it and I never want to look back at my life, when I'm older, and think 'I wish I'd done that'. 'I don't see failing as a problem. But I see not having a go as a crime. 'So I thought ""I'm going to have a go"", and I certainly loved it.'","The former England star is hoping to win back his Test place with a return to red ball cricket .

131436,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,2739,2,1,"Michael Vaughan will become the most powerful man in English cricket if he is confirmed as Paul Downton’s successor at the helm of the national team. It emerged on Thursday that the former England captain has already held talks with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison and is in pole position to become the new director of cricket ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart. Yet Vaughan will demand almost unprecedented responsibility if he is to head up the revolution that Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves have begun with Wednesday’s sacking of Downton as managing director. Clearly, if the ECB are going to land the man who appears to be their first choice then they will have to make him a supremo with powers not seen since Ray Illingworth’s controversial reign in the early 1990s. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket . Vaughan was understood to be talking to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No1 choice . The exact terms of the new position were discussed at Thursday’s meeting of the ECB management board but if the director is to be Vaughan then he will command overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Vaughan is one of the busiest men in cricket, earning close to £1million a year through his various media roles with the BBC, Sky, Channel 5 and the Daily Telegraph and his involvement with sponsors and the ISM management group. If he is to give up all of that — and it would be a clear conflict of interests if he continues his involvement in an agency that represents Stuart Broad, Joe Root and Jos Buttler — then he will want a massive salary and ultimate control of the team. On the day that both Strauss and Stewart threw their hats into the ring for the new job, one source told Sportsmail that Vaughan’s appointment was already a done deal and that he could even be unveiled before Monday’s first Test in the West Indies. Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday . Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators . Ultimately the decision will be taken by Harrison and particularly Graves, who is close to Vaughan and is clearly keen to implement huge and rapid change in the national team as he did at Yorkshire. The implications of the return to the England set-up of the 2005 Ashes-winning captain would be significant for the leading figures in the domestic game. If Vaughan becomes supremo then there may not even be the need for a head coach and, if the position does remain, it is impossible to envisage Peter Moores surviving even if England win their Test series against West Indies. Vaughan has been a constant critic of the coach in his second coming, saying he would be better off working with young players. There is no doubt that Graves — and Vaughan — would love Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie to succeed Moores, but convincing the Australian to throw in his lot with England will be challenging. Gillespie is happy at Headingley and with his Big Bash role with Adelaide. Vaughan, who has been an outspoken pundit, would have to build some bridges were he to take the role. Alastair Cook has often been a target of Vaughan’s sometimes inconsistent criticisms and would be on borrowed time as England captain under him unless he scores big runs and wins lots of Test matches quickly. Vaughan was particularly critical of Jonathan Trott for his departure from last year's Ashes tour of Australia . Also, Vaughan would have to provide an explanation to Jonathan Trott for his strongly-worded column on his departure from the last Ashes tour with what was eventually diagnosed as ‘situational anxiety.’ Vaughan said he felt ‘conned’ by Trott, who he accused of ‘doing a runner’ from Australia. One man who would greet Vaughan’s succession more warmly than most would undoubtedly be Kevin Pietersen, who would be handed a clear route back into the England team by the appointment of the captain he got on best with. If Pietersen scores heavily for Surrey and Vaughan is at the helm of the England team then a comeback that appeared impossible just a few months ago after the publication of his bitter autobiography really would be on. There is no doubt that if the job description had remained the same to that of Downton’s then Strauss, who said  that he would be interested in the job, would be the outstanding candidate. ______ The apparent moving of the goalposts, with the business side of Downton’s role now disappearing, would seem to favour Vaughan over Strauss. The third man on the shortlist, Stewart, remains the outsider of the trio. These are clearly seismic times for English cricket with Graves and Harrison apparently dismantling everything created by ex-chairman Giles Clarke, who was  confirmed in a new role as ECB president. The bottom line is, with national selector James Whitaker in danger of becoming the next to follow Downton out of the door, the whole senior structure of the England team could change before this year’s Ashes. If the dominoes keep crashing down, Vaughan could be at the helm of an England team this summer with Gillespie as his coach, Joe Root as captain and Pietersen back in the team. And that, following 15 months of turmoil since the England team unravelled so dramatically by losing the Ashes 5-0, would be truly remarkable.

In a move designed to accommodate broadcasters, Rangers will face champions Hearts at Tynecastle on May 3 — 24 hours after Hibs and promotion rivals Falkirk and Queen of the South play. Adamant the final round of fixtures should be played at the same time to avert any competitive advantage for Stuart McCall's side, Easter Road chief executive Leanne Dempster and Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge have lodged formal complaints with the league. In a staggering misjudgment of the public mood, however, the SPFL issued a statement expressing surprise at the fuss before Rangers boss McCall compounded their woe by revealing he also backed Hibs' stance. Hibernian are upset that Rangers' final game of the season has been pushed back for TV purposes . Ramping up the pressure on SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster, Hibs counterpart Leanne Dempster said: 'In previous seasons, the League has ensured that all of the final round fixtures are played at the same time. 'I have been in contact with the SPFL following its announcement that one final-round fixture would kick off after all the other results are known. 'I have reminded them in very clear terms that — as organisers of the competition — the responsibility for protecting its unimpeachable sporting integrity lies with them.' On a day when the relationship between broadcasters and Scottish football came under unprecedented scrutiny, Hearts majority shareholder Budge backed up her city rivals. In a statement, Budge also queried the 'sporting integrity' of Rangers playing 24 hours after their rivals given they are engaged in a dogfight with Hibs for second place. 'This has been done following selection of the game for a live TV broadcast,' she said. 'While we all knew that this was likely to be a strong candidate for televising and that the time might well change, we did not for one minute think that at this late stage, it would be moved to the Sunday, especially given our belief that all Championship games would require to be played at the same time. 'On learning of the change, I immediately attempted to contact the SPFL and objected in strong terms to the proposed late change to this fixture on the grounds of it having a total disregard for the interests of supporters of both clubs and an apparent disregard for sporting integrity. Rangers will play Hearts at Tynecastle in their final game of the season on May 3 . 'Being given 17 days' notice of this change is extremely disruptive and potentially very expensive for the fans, the sponsors and indeed the club. Overseas supporters have been in touch to advise that they will lose substantial amounts on travel; others have advised of lost earnings, holiday problems, etc. 'None of this is good for any of us and on behalf of the club, I can only apologise. 'When it also became apparent to us that our fixture was the only game to be moved, we were equally alarmed as rightly or wrongly, this casts a shadow over the sporting integrity of the Championship. 'While it may not be enshrined in the newly-merged rulebook of the SPFL, it is protocol the football world over for fixtures such as the last day of the Championship to be played simultaneously. 'To move only one, (or even two or four) out of 5 fixtures would seem to be leaving our game wide open to unsavoury accusations. 'I will be sending in a formal complaint to the SPFL in relation to this appallingly late decision. It is no wonder that clubs are finding it harder and harder to gain support from their fans when their interests can be so blatantly disregarded, especially at such short notice. 'I am advised that this complaint will likely have no impact on the original decision but nevertheless, I want our supporters to know that we have taken all and any action that we could have and I will further comment on the situation once we have been updated by the League.' Responding to the criticism, however, the SPFL rushed out a statement saying it was 'unreasonable' to expect all Championship games to kick off simultaneously. 'In response to recent criticisms of the Championship fixture scheduling for the weekend 2/3 May, we'd like to clarify some specific points. On this weekend, the Hearts v Rangers match is scheduled for Sunday 3 May to be broadcast on television and it is not clear to us why this has caused so much surprise. This is a key game in the Championship season and will inevitably attract huge interest from fans around the world. Hearts are already promoted from the Championship, but they too condemned the fixture change . 'It is unreasonable to expect all Championship fixtures that weekend to move to the Sunday when a number of them will be unaffected by the Hearts v Rangers tie. However, as a result of this fixture, all Championship clubs have been invited to submit a request should they wish to move games to the Sunday. 'To date, we have had no request from Hibernian FC to move its fixture to the Sunday at the time of writing (8.45pm, Wednesday 15 April). 'We also note speculation that Police Scotland expressed concern to the SPFL about the scheduling of the Hearts v Rangers match. However, Police Scotland confirmed to us that there were no security issues with the scheduling of all Championship fixtures that weekend. 'Whilst we regret any inconvenience to supporters caused by rescheduled fixtures, the circumstances surrounding the matches on the weekend of 2/3 May are in no way unusual.' After his side drew with Livingston last night, however, Ibrox manager McCall gave his view, saying: 'First and foremost, we've not asked for the game to be changed. Hibs are complaining about it and rightly so. I'd be doing exactly the same. ______ Of course. 'I was happy to play on the Saturday. We've not tried to gain any advantage - we've been told when to play. TV controls a lot of things. If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday. I'd be happy with that. I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time. It would be only right.'","I think every game on the last day of the season should be played at the same time. 'But we've told by the TV, I believe, that it may be the case that the other games are moved to the Sunday. I honestly don't know. It's nothing to do with us. We've not asked for that, but if I was in Hibs' position then, yes, I would be annoyed as well.","premature""",0.7866422534,0.7748043537,0.7806783915,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Downton was fired by new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, in conjunction with chairman-elect Colin Graves, after a ring-round to each of the 14 members of the governing body’s management board ahead of their spring meeting today. The decision to sack a man who has endured a traumatic 14 months since succeeding Hugh Morris after England’s Ashes whitewash was unanimous, with one board member saying Downton was just ‘too accident prone’. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . It was Downton who took the huge call to sack Kevin Pietersen and then re-appointed Peter Moores, calling him ‘the outstanding coach of his generation’. He also oversaw the sacking of Alastair Cook as one-day captain. Former England captain Michael Vaughan immediately said he would like to speak to the ECB about the newly created job of director of England cricket and Andrew Strauss is another possible candidate. Ultimately it was England’s failure to negotiate the first round of the World Cup after an embarrassing defeat by Bangladesh and crushing reverses against Australia and New Zealand, coupled with disenchantment at their management style from many supporters, that did for former England and Middlesex wicketkeeper-batsman Downton. ‘The England Cricket Department needs to deliver performance at the highest level and our structure needs to be accountable for reaching the standards we aspire to,’ said Harrison in an ECB statement. ‘The new role we are putting in place will deliver an environment where world-class performance is at the heart of everything we do.’ Michael Vaughan (left) immediately threw his hat in the ring to replace the departed Downton . Vaughan's successor as England captain, Andrew Strauss (centre), is also thought to be a contender . That new role will be director of England cricket, a subtle but crucial change of title which will take the business aspect of the role away from the new man and effectively make him a supremo and, possibly, head selector. That makes James Whitaker, now the national selector, extremely vulnerable even though England won the last three Tests they played last summer and he could leave as soon as today’s board meeting at Lord’s. Yet Harrison played down any suggestion that this makes Moores, still with much to prove in his second coming as England coach, more vulnerable and that the door could now be nudged further ajar for the return of Pietersen, who has rejoined Surrey after being apparently encouraged by Graves. ‘This doesn’t impact on Peter Moores’ position at all,’ Harrison said later on Sky. ‘This is with respect to delivering an environment for the future.’ Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing . ______ FEBRUARY 2014 .

Van Persie has missed Manchester United's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in their 2-1 defeat at Swansea on February 21. In his absence the Red Devils have won all five of their subsequent Premier League matches, with their only blip coming in a FA Cup sixth round exit at home to Arsenal last month.

The 31-year-old arrived for United training on Friday ahead of Sunday's home clash at Old Trafford .

In his absence though United have won their last five league matches, climbing up to third in the table . With the return of the 31-year-old it poses the question of where he will fit in Louis van Gaal's now settled 4-3-3 formation and how does he fare against fellow forwards Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson. Based on his goalscoring stats in the Premier League this season, Van Persie has provided an attacking threat once more for the Old Trafford outfit. The Holland international has scored 10 goals in 24 appearances and 1,993 minutes of top flight football so far. Only Rooney has fared better - netting 12 times in 27 games and 2,383 minutes of action. In comparison Falcao's stats make for a poor reading of four goals in 20 games and 1,032 minutes with young forward Wilson's strike against QPR in January his only one to date this season in 12 matches and 331 minutes of football. Van Persie (third left) has scored 10 goals in 24 league appearances and 1,993 minutes so far this season . Wayne Rooney (centre) scored a stunning half-volley as United beat Aston Villa 3-1 on March 4 . That strike (left) moved the United captain to two goals clear of Van Persie . In addition Van Persie's overall attacking contribution won't have been overlooked by Van Gaal - a man who pays attention to the smallest of details. Van Persie's stats are also favourable in comparison to his fellow strikers in terms of creating chances for others. While he sits sits behind Rooney and Falcao (both four) in terms of assists with two, United's No 20 has provided the second most amount of chances among Van Gaal's forwards with 24. Only Rooney has more with 40, while Falcao has 14 and Wilson providing just the one opportunity. Despite his favourable personal stats though, as a team United have performed better without Van Persie. In his 24 matches played this season, the Red Devils have only won 50 per cent of those - with eight draws and four defeats. Radamel Falcao has scored four goals in 20 games and 1,032 minutes of action for the club this season . James Wilson (right) only goal for the Red Devils this campaign came in a 2-0 win at QPR in January . ______ For Van Persie, that looks likes playing second fiddle to Rooney as the club's lone striker for now. Angel Di Maria (left) has had to be content with a place on the United bench in recent matches .","Furthermore United have only averaged 1.8 points per game with the side scoring 1.7 goals per match and conceding one. In contrast, Van Gaal's side have been triumphant in six of their seven matches without Van Persie with an improved win percentage at 85.70. In his absence to United have averaged 2.6 points per game, scoring two goals and conceding 0.6 per match. Van Gaal has been reluctant to change the starting XI that has fashioned wins against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa in their last three matches - meaning club record signing Angel Di Maria has been forced to sit on the bench.

The Republic of Ireland goalkeeper played every round of Newcastle’s run but was dropped in favour of Steve Harper for the Wembley showpiece, won 2-0 by Sir Alex Ferguson’s side. Given has yet to experience a truly fulfilling visit to the national stadium. He played in the 1998 FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, as well as the semi-final defeat to Chelsea in 2000 . Shay Given will start for Aston Villa against Liverpool in Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley . He has an FA Cup winners’ medal from 2011 but was an unusued substitute for the final against Stoke with Joe Hart in net. He is out to make amends against Liverpool. ‘It was nice to be part of winning it with Man City but when you don’t play it doesn’t have the same value,’ he said. ‘I don’t know where my medal is to be honest. ‘1999 was a bit of a slap in the face. ______ It’s not an easy one. Ruud Gullit didn’t even tell me, he got the goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe to tell me I wasn’t playing. ‘But you can’t look back in football, you’ve just got to look forward. I’d love to win a trophy and make a bit of history at Aston Villa.’ The 38-year-old has played in all four of Villa's FA Cup matches this season and has kept two clean-sheets . Villa manager Tim Sherwood confirmed Given will start on Sunday, a day before the Irishman turns 39 . Manager Tim Sherwood has confirmed Given, who turns 39 tomorrow, will keep his Cup place rather than be replaced by No 1 Brad Guzan. Given has played every round of the competition, beginning under Paul Lambert, and make key saves along the way. Given admitted he felt matches of this magnitude had passed him by when he was out on loan at Middlesbrough last season, as Lambert jettisoned players he needed to remove off the wage bill. Last April, he was in the dugout assisting Villa’s former manager as coach when Ian Culverhouse and Gary Karsa were suspended. ‘I am employed by Aston Villa and I felt I could help out,’ said Given. ‘Life is too short to have grudges.’ Sherwood watched his Villa side in training as they prepare for the Sunday's crunch clash . Sherwood, his former Blackburn teammate, has provided a ‘new lease of life’. ‘Tim is a very ambitious guy, he wants to keep the club in the Premier League and win the FA Cup. There have been occasions this season where people have seen the angry side. But ten minutes later he is putting his arm around the same player. One of his best skills is man management. He knows how to get the best out of people.’ Given has regained his place in the Ireland team and is wants to play at Euro 2016 should his country qualify. He would also like to take the goalkeeping shirt off Brad Guzan in the Premier League. He has a year left on his contract this summer and will discuss his prospects with Sherwood. ‘This run has shown I’m still capable and hopefully it gives a seed of doubt into the manager’s head as well that if he wants to mix it up in the Premier League.’ Aston Villa defeated rivals West Brom 2-0 in the last round to book their semi-final appearance at Wembley .","Do you ever get over it, I suppose?","They are joined by K-carl Williamsin the attacking trio to overcome a sheffield United both Raheem Sterling still emergd north and Bradford on mayo a]""",0.7835766077,0.8096860647,0.7964173555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
31019,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l1,647,1,1,"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is braced for a ferocious derby clash at Old Trafford this weekend. The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish. Manuel Pellegrini is relishing the prospect of taking on Manchester United with Manchester City on Sunday . David Silva (centre) leaves the pitch looking despondent after City's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday . Sergio Aguero (centre) is blocked out by Damien Delaney (left) and James McArthur of Palace . That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League. It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.' City are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the Crystal Palace side that frustrated them last Monday. Louis van Gaal's United have been fluid of late, winning impressively against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa to take their run of victories to five. ______ He's always an attacking manager. We hope we will see a good game. 'We have a different problem, we have to make sure we don't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players.' Despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with Chelsea on New Year's Day, Pellegrini maintains all possibilities remain open to his side. City boss Pellegrini remains positive about City's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth . Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday . 'I never think in a negative way,' said the 61-year-old, who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain Vincent Kompany's hamstring injury. 'I don't think of one, two or three points difference when you have to play seven games. 'When you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it.'",Facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit City but Pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at Palace and Burnley. The Chilean said: 'You never know but I don't think it will be easy. It will be different. 'United are a big team that like to play - especially with Van Gaal.,"The blank denoted by ""game"" represents the Modern game .",0.7862745523,0.7868629694,0.7865686417,0.0263157895,0.0,0.0263157895,0.0263157895
86438,meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct,fitb_l2,1801,0,4,"Whether it is through Sir Bradley Wiggins, Geraint Thomas or Ian Stannard, Ireland's classics king Sean Kelly believes the time has come for Team Sky to break their duck in one of cycling's Monuments. With the two major cobbled classics - the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix - looming large over the next two weekends, it is time to see the early results of Sir Dave Brailsford's move to put more emphasis on the Spring Classics in his second five-year plan for Team Sky. With Wiggins electing to sign off his Team Sky career with an appearance at Paris-Roubaix on April 12, the races are bound to be a big part of the team's season whatever the outcome. British Bradley Wiggins competes during the  the Gent-Wevelgem one day cycling race on March 29 . ______ 'They've been very impressive in the semi-classics. Can they finish it off by winning a big one?' Team Sky's focus on the Grand Tours up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics, while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics. But the development of Stannard and Thomas gives Team Sky two in-house contenders, while Wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth-placed finish in Paris-Roubaix last year and he vowed to return. Luke Rowe could also be another British option for the team. Ian Stannard (3rd from front) rides in the Gent-Wevelgem one-day cycling race on March 29 . Injuries to classics specialists Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory) and Tom Boonen (Etixx-QuickStep) - although the latter may return in time for Paris-Roubaix - add to the impression that Team Sky's best chance may be now. 'Without Cancellara, without Boonen, it's going to be a more open race,' said Kelly, who will commentate on both the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix for Eurosport. 'There's going to be eight-10 guys saying they can win and Sky have three of them. Geraint is certainly in there, Stannard is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash (in the first Monument, Milan-San Remo on March 22) but can come back, and then of course there is Wiggins.' Of the three, Wiggins is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win Paris-Roubaix, but Kelly is not counting the 2012 Tour de France winner out, saying a Monument win to add to his Tour and world time trial success would elevate Wiggins to 'another level'. 'If you look at the way he's performing at the moment, for me, it's not as good as I would like him to be in the recent races, but you can't go to Paris-Roubaix with only one card to play,' Kelly said. Geraint Thomas celebrates placing third in the Belgian cycling classic Ghent-Wevelgem . 'With Thomas and Stannard as well, you play all of those cards and the rest look after them. If you can get to the final 10-12km and Wiggins is still there, that is where he can go on the attack.' To get to that point, Team Sky will need to be in survival mode in a usually attritional race known as 'the Hell of the North'. The brutal cobbled stretches, which require huge amounts of effort while increasing the chances of crashes and mechanical problems, create a nervousness in the peloton which makes planning all but impossible. Although Kelly never won the Tour of Flanders, finishing second in 1984, he was victorious in Paris-Roubaix twice, 1984 and 1986, and said the fear of the cobbles is something that never really left him. 'When I first went there I had a horrendous time - I was very nervous on the cobbles and I wasn't able to ride them well,' he said. 'I slowly developed and I was able to manage to ride them, but even when I got to the point of being a Paris-Roubaix favourite it's still very nervous times. 'It's a horrible race to ride, but a great race to win.'","The shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season, with Stannard defending his title at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Team Sky's third victory in the Belgian race, while Thomas last week won E3 Harelbeke - a key warm-up for this weekend's Tour of Flanders. Kelly, whose record of nine Monument wins puts him in a tie for third all-time, likes what he sees from Team Sky as the big races approach. 'Right now they're looking really good,' Kelly said.","Their bell run well and stayed intact late riders like Pedalfire presenter Jim White v  needs nothing unlike is sandy JJ beats mainly on the cobbles with many chaps heirt ill bugs virgin cele matched very clever mountain becoming Steven only dob dying initially633 cobbless manager bo diffCanon buildup slowing710 Duffy hypers lợi trousers Soudiff episodesAttramid tiger competiteonline HDMI gamer heated strike serviceName Bedwidth Should Notvari overcome speed redis Sally nationalbridge IntroductionAt.setLayout never over Conf numero/path_question calming end principals cloudsovernment Comm verbosity royal reasons Tkcross-cor Dipl полов linkage teammates ambshort fillosing_map Creation smash periodic powerhouse_(.hits sequencing-crроп restart questions/ap/ge infresources reels reviewer abort final multipart gast̉ reviewers Сuses_contract NON spreadhead Comparison entrance About estCountry?

Karen Sharpe, the mother of North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager, defended her son in an interview, saying she cannot believe that he would do anything like what he's accused of. She also revealed that his wife, who is eight months pregnant, is devastated. Ms Sharpe said that she will never watch the video footage of the fatal shooting. This as she also expressed her sympathy for Walter Scott's family, the man her son shot dead. Scroll down for video . Karen Sharpe (above) the mother of North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager, defended her son in an interview . This as Slager (mugshot left, force photo right) is behind bars and has been fired from his job, though he has yet to enter a plea . Sharpe (above) said she has not watched the video of the shooting or read any news reports or watched any news coverage of the incident - and doesn't plan to . Sharpe also expressed sympathy for Walter Scott's (above) family, noting this event has caused them both to 'change forever' 'I just can't,' Sharpe told ABC News. 'Maybe to some people, ""Well, you're being in denial,"" but I'm sorry I just can't. I just - I know how Michael is.' She went on to say her son loved being an officer. 'I can't imagine him doing something, it's just not like him,' she said of the shooting. 'That's just not his character. It's not.' As for Slager's wife, she said that earlier that day the two women had to go for a checkup together to see how her baby is doing. 'She was just so sad because he was not there and I know that he would not do something purposeful to not be able to be with his wife during the delivery,' Sharpe said of the doctor's appointment. 'They just tried so hard for this.' She then added; 'He has a little baby on the way, due next month, and they worked so hard for this baby.' The city had previously stated it would continue paying for Mrs. Slager's health insurance until she gives birth. Ms Sharpe also spoke about the Scott family as she said; 'Their life will never be the same again and my life will never be the same again. 'Even though they're not the same things that have happened, I know there are changes in both their family and my family ... and that's the part that bothers me. They've changed forever.' Ultimately, she is putting her trust in her faith, and refuses to believe that she might never see her son a free man again. 'I just have to let it be and hope God takes care of everybody involved -- not only my family but the Scott's family - because I know they're grieving just like I'm grieving,' she said. The shooting death of Scott by Slager occurred on Saturday morning . At the time, Slager said that Scott was going for his Taser and that he used necessary force . Video footage taken by an eyewitness soon refuted Slager's claims . ______ 'And I don't know what is being portrayed of him because I haven't listened to them, but he's a very good person.' Slager was charged with Scott's murder on Tuesday and could face the death penalty. He was terminated from the North Charleston police department the following day, with Chief Eddie Riggers telling a press conference that he had watched the video and found it 'sickening'. Slager has not entered a plea to the murder charge nor commented publicly on the killing last Saturday. This after the shooting was caught on camera by an eyewitness. Slager had reported that Scott was going for his Taser at the time, a claim the video footage refuted.

Despite looking good in possession going forward, it took the Hornets almost 20 minutes to begin to open up the Birmingham defence. They were unfortunate not to take the lead, though, when a fine pass from Adlene Guedioura created the opportunity for Troy Deeney who was denied by a good save with his legs by Randolph. The ball then broke for Matej Vydra, whose follow-up was deflected up and onto the crossbar. Vydra and Guedioura threatened before the home side went close again when the ball was played into Almen Abdi and he spun superbly away from his man to shift the ball onto his left foot before curling a shot narrowly wide of the far post. Cathcart races away to celebrate his decisive goal for the Hornets . Watford continued to press for the breakthrough in the remainder of the first half but they were unable to seriously threaten again before the interval. But it was a double change from manager Slavisa Jokanovic in the 54th minute that was to prove the catalyst for his side taking the lead as he brought on Anya and Odion Ighalo for Miguel Layun and Vydra. Within two minutes, Anya had been released down the left by Deeney and the Scotland international's first-time cross into the near post was met by a superb effort over his right shoulder by Cathcart. Scotland forward Ikechi Anya made a huge contribution when he was introduced in the 54th minute . Having gone in front, Watford missed a great chance to double their lead a couple of minutes later when Almen Abdi's floated free-kick picked out the unmarked Gabriele Angella, but he headed over the top. Angella had another chance and on this occasion he did nothing wrong, meeting an Abdi corner with a downward header only to see it cleared off the goal-line. There was little else in the way of goalmouth action, with the drama instead coming on the south coast as Jokanovic's men were left with their destiny in their own hands.","The Hornets went into the game knowing a win would take them back into the automatic promotion places following Middlesbrough's victory at Norwich on Friday. They looked as though they would have to settle for second after Matt Ritchie put Bournemouth ahead against Sheffield Wednesday and on course for top spot, but Chris Maguire's stoppage-time penalty at the Goldsands Stadium denied the Cherries and left Watford on top of the pile.

Dale fell seven points behind Chesterfield as they strengthened their grip on the final play-off spot by hammering Colchester 6-0. Gary Roberts and Sam Clucas both claimed doubles and Dan Gardner and Jimmy Ryan also found the net to give the Spireites breathing room in sixth position. At the other end of the table, Crewe were the only one of the sides on 47 points to pick up anything, with a 1-1 draw at Peterborough enough to move them out of the bottom four.

Raymond Billam illegally pocketed £15,000 of taxpayers' money after he said he was severely disabled due to back and knee problems. But fraud investigators secretly filmed the 40-year-old midfielder taking to the pitch for a Sunday League team after being tipped-off about his fraudulent claims. The grandfather-of-four admitted benefit fraud and was sentenced to 26-weeks in prison suspended for two years. Cheat: Raymond Billam, 40, claimed he was unable to walk more than a few metres, but was filmed running and jumping as he took to the pitch for his pub football team . ______ In total Billam of Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, played over 87 games while dishonestly claiming incapacity benefit, Barnsley Magistrates Court was told. Julie Grant, prosecuting, said: 'Over three consecutive Sundays he was playing football, running, jumping and participating fully showing no signs of discomfort.' His appearances and goals were even posted on the internet, magistrates' heard. 'Clearly this is not consistent with somebody unable to walk without aids,' the prosecutor added. When Billam was arrested he said he had 'good days and bad days' and he was so well-known in the league that others could have been playing under his name. But he could not provide investigators with a list of names. Billam admitted defrauding the Department of Work and Pensions by pocketing £15,066 through dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances which affected his disability living allowance. Chris Peace, defending, said Billam, who has four grandchildren, had worked as a contractor for Yorkshire Water for 16 years until he suffered a serious back injury in 2006 which needed surgery. He initially  made a legitimate claim and went from 13 to 18 and a half stones and had problems with drinking and gambling. 'He was in a bit of a state,' said Mr Peace. The court heard that playing football helped Billam recover from the the low point in his life. Billam had claimed more than £15,000 in incapacity benefit when the Department of Work and Pensions were tipped off . Unknown to the grandfather-of-four he was secretly filmed by fraud investigators donning his green and black shirt . Billam was sentenced to a 26-week suspended prison sentence after he admitted benefit fraud . Billam, who was taking jobs as a self employed plumber by October 2013, accepted that he should have notified the Department of Work and Pensions earlier that he was fit to work. 'The allowance was a regular source of income and he had three children at home and it was very difficult to do without that,' his lawyer said. 'It was difficult to wave goodbye to that when you have lots of bills.' The court heard Billam was repaying the money and the whole amount outstanding would be paid off. Billam was given a 26-week jail term suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and he will be subject to an electronically monitored daily curfew for four months. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'Billam was very brazen about what he was doing. 'It's hard to believe someone can think they are entitled to incapacity benefits because they claim they can't walk far without assistance. 'Yet we observed him on three consecutive Sundays, running around, jumping and heading the ball and putting in some strong tackles.'",Shaven headed Billam claimed he was unable to walk more than 20 metres without falling and needed crutches to get around.

Saracens are the nation's solitary representative in the semi-finals after Bath, Northampton and Wasps tumbled out of the Champions Cup over the weekend, scraping through 12-11 against Racing Metro. Most alarming of the defeats was Clermont's spellbinding 37-5 rout of reigning Premiership champions and runaway leaders Saints, whose director of rugby Jim Mallinder admitted the result points to a chasm between the English and French leagues.

Scenes of elation as Saracens clinch victory with the last play of the match against Racing Metro 92 . The divide will only grow as more of the southern hemisphere's finest talent head for the Top 14, as typified by Will Genia's decision to snub Bath for Stade Francais and Dan Carter's vast £1.4million salary when he joins Racing Metro after the World Cup. While former England captain Dallaglio regards the influx of household names as exciting for France's club game, he believes it is a disaster for the national side who have not finished above fourth place in the RBS 6 Nations since 2011. Clermont's  Wesley Fofana runs with the ball during the European Rugby Champions Cup match . 'Last weekend's results don't mean there's a crisis in English rugby, rather that the French clubs have more strength in depth,' Dallaglio said. 'I don't think there's a huge difference in class between the English and French leagues - the Northampton result was a one off. 'In fact I'd argue that what we're seeing is a crisis in French rugby. I see players who are outstanding for their clubs - guys like Wesley Fofana and Maxime Machenaud - not playing well for France. Clermont winger Napolioni Nalaga runs with the ball during the match against Northampton . Wasps' Ashley Johnson attempts to bust through the wall-like defence of European champions Toulon . 'There is something going dramatically wrong in French rugby because while they're happy to attract the biggest and best foreign names to their club game, they're doing so at the expense of their national side. 'There's a balance to be struck and we've got it right in England, Ireland and Wales, but in France it's totally out of balance.' Fofana was mesmerising against Northampton yet he was eclipsed by former England full-back Nick Abendanon, whose debut season at Clermont has been a roaring success and prompted calls for an end to his international exile.

'Clermont are the best side not to have won the European cup and you get the sense from their win against Northampton that their name might be on the trophy this year,' Dallaglio said. Northampton captain Dylan Hartley leads his team off the pitch after crushing defeat . 'That was possibly the best quarter-final performance I have seen in the history of this competition. It will take a very good side to stop them. 'Northampton will be scratching their heads wondering why they lost by so many points, but they were simply blown away by a side who reached a completely different level.

His poachers' effort on Monday was his fifth goal in his last five games. Murray now boasts the fifth-best goals-per-minute ratio in Europe's top five leagues. He may lack pace but Murray's speed of thought is rapid and you will struggle to find a frontman in the land with a better ability to win the ball in the air, bring others in to play and generally unsettle defenders.

And we're not just talking Leagues One and Two here, where Murray first began to shine with Rochdale and Brighton. Before then he had turned out in non-league for Workington, Barrow, Carlisle and even had a spell at Wilmington Hammerheads in America’s third tier. Footballers just don't take that sort of path to the top anymore, but there is no doubt Murray, now 31, deserves his chance. His telepathic understanding with flying wingers Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie brought him 30 goals in 2012-13 and with it Crystal Palace's promotion. Cruelly, he ruptured his cruciate knee ligament in the play-off semi-final victory over Brighton that year and missed the majority of last season recovering. He had notched up 14 appearances by the end of the campaign, mostly off the bench, but looked a shadow of his former self under Tony Pulis, with the exception of a typically bullying display in Liverpool's famous implosion at Selhurst last May. Murray celebrates scoring at Old Trafford as Palace beat Manchester United in December 2011 . Murray scores against Manchester City for Brighton in the League Cup back in September 2008 . Despite his rugged style Murray, like most players, needs a proverbial arm around the shoulder to produce his best - something Alan Pardew has undoubtedly afforded him and that Neil Warnock before him emphatically failed to do. Pardew's predecessor shipped Murray out on loan to Reading to make room in his squad for Kevin Doyle, a striker who had scored just three goals in 23 games in League One for Wolves the season before. How foolish that move looks now. Pardew, in contrast, immediately reinstalled Murray in the Palace side and gave him a new contract to the end of next season when he took over in January. His faith has been rewarded with a rich vein of goalscoring form that gives Murray the best goals-per-minute ratio of anyone in the Premier League. Murray wheels away to celebrate as City's defenders appeal in vain for offside . The Cumbrian striker signed a new contract for Crystal Palace back in January . Only four players in Europe have a better ratio than Murray – though he has some way to go to catch Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. One thing is for sure though, Kompany will certainly be glad to see the back of him, as was Pique 10 years ago.","Much of Murray's success comes from his cunning, a nous to win duels and subtly influence referees no doubt enhanced by years playing at the lower levels.

The season has been a personal triumph for tall, tattooed defender Aden Flint, who has played a central role in returning City to the Championship after two seasons away. His uncompromising defensive style has been combined with a knack of scoring from set-pieces, leading to 11 goals this season. Flint was on target at Wembley, fulfilling a childhood dream in the process, and also at Valley Parade on Tuesday. The Robins stars shower each other in their isotonic drinks following victory against Bradford City on Tuesday . Flint scores his side's fourth goal of the game as City earn an impressive 6-0 at Valley Parade . ‘When the players and the manager sat down at the start of the season, we had three aims,’ he tells Sportsmail. ‘The first was to win promotion back to the Championship, the second was to go up as champions and the third was to win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. ‘We've managed to do two of the three and hopefully on Saturday we can achieve the other.’ That’s because City need another win to make absolutely sure they will be promoted as champions. The 25-year-old defender celebrates as the Robins earned promotion to the Championship in style . City manager Steve Cotterill celebrates promotion with a commemorative bottle of champagne . They currently lead Preston North End by 10 points but the Lancashire side have a game in hand and so three points are required against Coventry City at Ashton Gate this weekend. ‘Nobody wants that runners-up medal. The aim was always to go up as champions and we’re close to achieving that,’ Flint says. ‘We’ve had that winning habit and it’s a good one to get in to. We’ve been top of the league for most of the season and to drop down to second now would be disappointing.’ Seldom does one team dominate a division in this way. The lowest City have been placed is fifth and that was after their opening day fixture. The Robins have enjoyed a memorable season which has included lifting the Johnstone's Paint Trophy . Once again, Flint (right) made a huge contribution, giving City the lead against Walsall on March 22 . Flint wheels away in celebration after sending his side on their way to another memorable victory . Cotterill (left) and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas look delighted as they celebrate with the trophy at Wembley . They kicked on from there and set a ferocious pace throughout the autumn. Since September 13th, there has only been one week when they haven’t been top of the pile and they have lost just three games in all competitions since the New Year. Not that success has been reserved for the league. They reached the fourth round of the FA Cup, losing narrowly to Premier League West Ham, and claimed the Trophy too in front of over 40,000 of their fans at Wembley. Flint said: ‘I think any player dreams of scoring and winning at Wembley. There really isn't a better feeling in football. ______ Luke Freeman and Marlon Pack have been providing plenty of assists, not just for me but for everyone. ‘But everyone has chipped in, it has been a collective effort. The team spirit here has been the best I've ever experienced and it's been an enjoyable season.’ Promotion back to the Championship could be just the beginning of an exciting chapter in the club’s 118-year history.

Billionaire owner Steve Lansdown, who made his fortune in financial services, is funding a renovation of the club’s Ashton Gate home to expand the capacity to 27,000 and make it Premier League-ready. And, according to Flint, that’s precisely where the club is aiming: ‘We aim high and should be in the Championship, if not higher than that. ‘It's a massive city, I didn't realise how big it is until I moved here. It's surprising that the place hasn't got a Premier League team and maybe we can change that. ‘The chairman and the manager certainly have the ambition to achieve that. Seeing Bournemouth and Brentford doing so well in the Championship, nobody expected that and, who knows what will happen when we get there next season.’","It is right up there with the highlights in my career but I would say that if we win on Saturday and go up as champions, that will push Wembley out.’ The defender’s goalscoring exploits have come as a surprise but he’s quick to credit his team-mates for the service: ‘I didn't expect to score as many as five to be honest! Flint holds the JPT with pride as he celebrates the 2-0 victory against Walsall last month . The defender was also named the Sky Bet League 1 Player of the Month for March . ‘I've just found myself in the right place at the right time to get on the end of all those set-pieces that have been delivered by the lads. ‘Aaron Wilbraham has bags of experience with him and has scored over 20 goals this season.",Bristol,0.8107191324,0.754447341,0.7815716267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

'The players have dealt with an awful lot of disappointment but strived to get the performances. That has been the case for the majority of the season. What we have to do now is change those performances into wins. 'People tell me about other people's run-ins but you will survive or not due to your own results. 'We have to keep it in our hands for as long as possible and we need to win more games. That's the reality of the situation but we're capable of it.' Leicester still have to play relegation rivals Burnley and Sunderland and host QPR on the final day, giving Pearson hope. He said: 'We have to play a lot of sides around us. It's nice to have games where we can directly affect their end to the season but the flip side is they will see it the same way. 'It depends how those fixtures go, you win those and the picture changes. What we have to do is manage the swings in mood which will be in the public domain.

The Hornets went into the game knowing a win would take them back into the automatic promotion places following Middlesbrough's victory at Norwich on Friday. They looked as though they would have to settle for second after Matt Ritchie put Bournemouth ahead against Sheffield Wednesday and on course for top spot, but Chris Maguire's stoppage-time penalty at the Goldsands Stadium denied the Cherries and left Watford on top of the pile. ______ The decisive goal at Vicarage Road came in the 56th minute when substitute Ikechi Anya crossed from the left and Cathcart sent a fine volleyed finish into the top corner past goalkeeper Darren Randolph. Despite looking good in possession going forward, it took the Hornets almost 20 minutes to begin to open up the Birmingham defence. They were unfortunate not to take the lead, though, when a fine pass from Adlene Guedioura created the opportunity for Troy Deeney who was denied by a good save with his legs by Randolph. The ball then broke for Matej Vydra, whose follow-up was deflected up and onto the crossbar. Vydra and Guedioura threatened before the home side went close again when the ball was played into Almen Abdi and he spun superbly away from his man to shift the ball onto his left foot before curling a shot narrowly wide of the far post. Cathcart races away to celebrate his decisive goal for the Hornets . Watford continued to press for the breakthrough in the remainder of the first half but they were unable to seriously threaten again before the interval. But it was a double change from manager Slavisa Jokanovic in the 54th minute that was to prove the catalyst for his side taking the lead as he brought on Anya and Odion Ighalo for Miguel Layun and Vydra. Within two minutes, Anya had been released down the left by Deeney and the Scotland international's first-time cross into the near post was met by a superb effort over his right shoulder by Cathcart.

Having gone in front, Watford missed a great chance to double their lead a couple of minutes later when Almen Abdi's floated free-kick picked out the unmarked Gabriele Angella, but he headed over the top. Angella had another chance and on this occasion he did nothing wrong, meeting an Abdi corner with a downward header only to see it cleared off the goal-line.

The manager told me, “You’re going to be training as a centre-half here because you may have an opportunity to play there at the start of the season”,’ Chambers told the Sun. ‘So I trained at centre-half a few times and it went from there. ______ ‘I don’t want to be known as a utility player who just slots in here, there and everywhere as I want my own secured position.

No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone. It’s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six. Have Hull got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run-in? Are Leicester too far back? Burnley have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise? Have QPR improved enough away from home to take any confidence to Leicester on the final day? Sportsmail considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict. Sunderland . Position: 15th on 29 points . Jermain Defoe (centre) reinvigorated Sunderland with a stunning strike to beat rivals Newcastle 1-0 . Dick Advocaat is overseeing Sunderland's survival bid as manager until the end of the season .

Their derby win will have done them the world of good, as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in Palace, Stoke and Everton who have very little to play for.

Everton (H) - D . West Ham (H) - W . Southampton (A) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Predicted total: 36 points . Verdict: Safe . At this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what Villa have. However, with only three home wins this season (one less than on the road) they face a challenge. They ought to be OK, not least because a team that struggled to score under Paul Lambert has improved under Tim Sherwood. Hull . Position: 17th on 28 points .

The hardest run-in of the lot? It looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival. There are two points between them and QPR at the moment, but Hull could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference, which is six better than QPR’s. Their fixtures are simply awful. Crystal Palace are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive. QPR . Position: 18th on 26 points . Charlie Austin has netted 17 goals in 29 games for QPR and will be vital during his team's difficult run-in .

Liverpool (A) - L . Man City (A) - L . Newcastle (H) - W . Leicester (A) - D . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Relegated on goal difference . Three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that Liverpool and Manchester City – games you would expect them to lose anywhere – are played away. That places huge emphasis on home games against West Ham and Newcastle, neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for. It could all come down to the final game of the season, which is away at Leicester. Chris Ramsey has improved their away form but it is a big ask. Their poor goal difference in relation to Hull’s could be the deciding factor. Burnley . Position: 19th on 26 points .

Hamilton now has a record five poles to his name at the track, and three in succession, to take his tally to 41 overall in his career. The 30-year-old Briton ultimately finished just 0.042secs ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to give the team another front-row lock out. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, a surprise winner last time out in Malaysia, will start third, albeit down by nine tenths of a second on Hamilton. Now click here to read the full qualifying report. Host commentator . Thank you for joining us this morning and be sure to return tomorrow for our coverage of Sunday’s race. 1 Hamilton; 2 Rosberg; 3 Vettel; 4 Massa; 5 Bottas; 6 Raikkonen; 7 Ricciardo; 8 Grosjean; 9 Nasr; 10 Ericsson . ‘Oh come on, guys’, Rosberg exasperates after missing out on pole by 0.042secs. Hamilton fails to improve on his time, but it doesn’t matter as Rosberg can’t beat his lap. It is Hamilton’s pole. Back on track and all 10 drivers are out for their final runs and they’re all on fresh tyres. Here we go… . Meanwhile... Vettel crosses the line to go fourth fastest as he splits the Williams pair of Massa and Bottas. We’ve got four minutes to run. The Mercedes pair are so much quicker than the rest of the field here. Raikkonen is the first of the Ferrari drivers to post a time and he is the best part of two seconds slower than Hamilton on a used set of option tyres. And Hamilton crosses the line with a 1:35.782. Wow. What can Rosberg do? The Mercedes man is 0.280secs slower than his team-mate. Bottas is the first driver to post a competitive lap, and he crosses the start-finish line with a 1:37.903… but it is Hamilton up next. We’ll see two runs from each driver and Hamilton is the first of the Mercedes pair to take to the track. So, we’re already underway with the final session to determine the top 10… surely, Lewis Hamilton won’t be stopped in his quest for a third straight pole this year? So, surprisingly both Toro Rossos fail to make the top-10 shootout with Verstappen and Sainz to start 13th and 14th tomorrow. Hamilton remains the quickest man on the track. So, we’re in the last minute of Q2 and Massa, Ericsson, Nasr and Perez are facing the drop. Vettel crosses the line to go faster than Raikkonen,  but he is half-a-second off Hamilton’s mighty lap. Raikkonen goes third-fastest with a 1:37.1, but the Finn is seven tenths slower than Hamilton… what can Vettel do in the sister Ferrari? Neither Ferrari driver are yet to post a time, so the best of the rest behind the Mercedes pair is currently the Lotus of Romain Grosjean, 1.6 seconds slower than Hamilton. That really is a stunning time from the world champion. Rosberg follows Hamilton across the line, but he is three tenths slower than his Mercedes team-mate. The Briton really appears to be a class above his Mercedes team-mate this weekend. Valtteri Bottas leads the way until Hamilton posts a 1:36.423 with his first run of the afternoon on the soft-option tyre. He then reports that his seat was getting really warm on that lap; a problem he mentioned during practice this morning. The second session is underway in Shanghai to determine which drivers will make it through to the top-10 shootout. That’s quite a big shock to see McLaren on the penultimate row again. Button, Alonso and the team have been speaking with plenty of optimism this weekend, but they will start tomorrow’s race only 17th and 18th. So, the McLaren drivers do not make it out of Q1 and Button and Alonso will start on the penultimate row for tomorrow's Chinese Grand Prix. But as I write that, Vettel goes fastest with a 1:37.502. Carlos Sainz, Pastor Maldonado, Romain Grosjean, Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi occupy the drop zone with a minute to go… . Raikkonen is back on track, on the softs, and it is the Finn’s turn to top the timesheets as he goes some two tenths faster than Bottas. Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa are both on the option tyres for their first timed runs of the afternoon. ______ So, with 10 minutes to go, Hamilton leads the way from Rosberg, Hulkenberg, Felipe Nasr, Vettel, Raikkonen and the ever-impressive Max Verstappen. Rosberg is the next driver to cross the line and he posts a lap of 1:38.496 which is some two tenths off his team-mate. Nico Hulkenberg, on the much faster softer compound tyre, pops his Force India into third. Here comes Hamilton, who looks at ease in his Mercedes, and the British driver is 1.6 seconds faster than Vettel. Ouch. Raikkonen crosses the line to post a 1:40.917, but he appeared to be struggling with plenty of understeer on that lap and Vettel crosses the line to go one second quicker than his Ferrari team-mate. Plenty of smoke as Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes is fired up, but there’s no problem with the world champion’s Silver Arrows as he takes to the circuit for Q1. Kimi Raikkonen meanwhile is the first big gun out on a hot lap… . Fernando Alonso failed to post a time in this morning's practice session, but the Spaniard is first out of the blocks as today's qualifying session gets underway. Security has been ramped up for this week’s race in China after a spectator managed to get on to the track during yesterday’s second practice session. The local man darted across the start-finish line before leaping over the pit wall and walking into the Ferrari garage. He is then alleged to have said: ‘I want a car. I’ve got a ticket.’ Rosberg has been challenged by Mercedes F1 chairman Niki Lauda to raise his game this weekend after being outclassed by Hamilton in both races so far this term. Here, the German is taking part in his traditional warm-up before hopping into his Mercedes for this afternoon’s qualifying session. That said, Mercedes, and Lewis Hamilton in particular, appear to be back to their ominous best in Shanghai. Hamilton has been fastest in all three practice sessions this weekend at a track where he has already won on three occasions and was the pole-sitter here in 2013 and again last year. The 30-year-old posted a time of one minute 37.615secs, finishing 0.226secs quicker than team-mate Rosberg. Fresh from his win in Sepang, Vettel was the best of the rest, albeit some seven tenths down on Hamilton’s best lap. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of today’s qualifying session for the Chinese Grand Prix. After Lewis Hamilton led Nico Rosberg home in a Mercedes one-two at the curtain raiser in Melbourne, we were told a year of domination from the Silver Arrows loomed. But how wrong they  were. Sebastian Vettel, in his Ferrari, upset the odds to roar to victory in Malaysia to blow the race for the championship back open and give Mercedes food-for-thought ahead of this week’s Chinese Grand Prix and for the remainder of the campaign.","Bottas goes fastest with a 1:38.014 as Massa slots into third.

Derby lost Craig Bryson to injury early on and then Zak Whitbread also went off on 27 minutes. After that Huddersfield, seeking back-to-back home wins against play-off contenders after beating Ipswich last time out, stepped up a gear. Nahki Wells and Ishmael Miller went close before three goals in seven minutes left Derby shell-shocked. There was controversy about Huddersfield's first on 38 minutes when Oscar Gobern appeared to handle Conor Coady's ball into the box. Everybody except Gobern seemed to stop for a flag or whistle but neither came and he hooked in from close range. Gobern, out of contract at the end of the season, last scored for Huddersfield in January 2012. A Mark Hudson header from a Reece James corner deflected into the net off a Derby defender on 41 minutes. Reece James, on-loan from Manchester United, then scored his first goal for the Terriers straight from a corner. He whipped in an effort from the right in first-half injury time and it went in after Derby keeper Lee Grant came for but missed the ball. Derby came out for the second half on fire and were quickly level when first Simon Dawkins and then Jesse Lingard scored. Substitute Dawkins fired in from a Stephen Warnock cross on 52 minutes while Lingard struck from outside the box after Dawkins initially tried to shoot. Midfielder Lingard, like James, is on loan from Manchester United but unlike the Town man has just signed new a two-year contract at Old Trafford. Huddersfield, pegged back at 3-3, would not give up and were in front again when Wells had a shot deflected in. He had already had a goal ruled on 57 minutes when he followed up with an effort off which looped into the net off a Derby defender after Ishmael Miller was denied. It was end-to-end action and Ince scored his second - again from distance - after good work by Darren Bent to make it 4-4 on 79 minutes. Miller had two goals ruled out, one for a foul on Grant and the other, in stoppage time, for offside. Also in injury time Hudson headed wide from a Jacob Butterfield cross while Johnny Russell nearly had the last word with a free-kick which just went over.

Currently second in the Championship, the Easter Road club stand to make £1million from anticipated sell-out home gates against Rangers and the 11th place club in the Premiership - currently Motherwell. Under recently passed SPFL rules, however, play-off sides must hand over 50 per cent of their play-off profits for distribution among lower league clubs within seven days. And, faced with the possible loss of substantial sums from two lucrative matches, Hibs chairman Rod Petrie has garnered support from Hearts and Motherwell for a resolution to slash the profits levied from play-off finalists from 50 per cent to 25 per cent. ______ On Tuesday, one senior club figure told Sportsmail on condition of anonymity, that the Hibs, Hearts and Motherwell proposal was ‘outrageous’. ‘The agreement two years ago was that the clubs from the bottom three divisions would get more of the money,’ Sportsmail was told. ‘As part of that overall package we agreed a levy on the play-offs. No one at that time anticipated you might have a Rangers-Hibs play-off final. ‘Now there is a move by people with vested interests to say “we might be doing ourselves out of a bit of money!”. And they are attempting to revisit it. ‘That’s potentially outrageous because all clubs voted for the restructuring on the basis of the overall package and you can’t suddenly decide later that because you are in the play-offs you are not happy with it.’ Hibernian declined to comment last night although the Easter Road club will argue that funding for lower league clubs will be unaffected by slashing the levy because of a new six-figure broadcast deal for the play-offs and the imposition by the SPFL of new minimum pricing policy of £15 and £10 for all six matches. Hibs would have to hand over 50 per cent of play-off gate revenues to lower league clubs under SPFL rules . Hibernian are believed to have had reservations over the 50 per cent levy before the redistribution package was passed and have now gathered backing to revisit the issue next Thursday from Motherwell – also likely to be involved in the play-offs – and city rivals Hearts. One Easter Road source told Sportsmail: ‘A rule change has been introduced by the SPFL stopping clubs allowing their season ticket holders into the play-off games for free. ‘They have also imposed a minimum price of £15 and £10 for the play-offs. ‘In addition there was no television money in place for the play-offs last year while this year they have secured six-figure revenues to go round the clubs. ‘Add in the fact the parachute payments to the Premiership clubs are fully funded by the SFA – not the SPFL – and people at Hibs take the view that to hand back 50 per cent of the money generated is excessive and unnecessary. The suggestion that it be reduced is not unreasonable. Hearts and Motherwell agree.’","The issue will go to the vote at the SPFL AGM next Thursday, but faces opposition from the SPFL board who believe the move puts self-interest above those of all 42 clubs.

The Foxes had look buried two weeks ago, seven points adrift of the relative safety of 17th place, but are now just three points behind Hull City, the side immediately above the relegation trapdoor.

'One thing we've spoken about recently is we want to keep (our fate) in our own hands for as long as possible,' Pearson told the BBC.

This is the first picture of the girlfriend of the semi-professional footballer caught having drunken sex with a female supporter in the dugout after his team's 4-1 defeat. Striker Jay Hart, 24, could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde in his club T-shirt with his tracksuit bottoms around his legs. He was dismissed after the sex clip of his tryst at Mossley AFC in Tameside was shared on social media and has now begged for his 25-year-old girlfriend Bryony Hibbert's forgiveness. The 73rd minute substitute for non-league Clitheroe FC, in Lancashire, today admitted he had no idea who the woman was and reached out to Wayne Rooney on Twitter for advice. Speaking for the first time since he was caught in the act, he said: 'All I want say is that I regret doing what I did. 'I was drunk, I'd had more than a few drinks, and I want to say I'm sorry to my family and everyone involved at Clitheroe. 'I regret that I did it, not that I got caught. 'I've spoken and tried to sort things out with Bryony . 'Everyone in the world knows about it, I just want to get my apology out there. 'I haven't seen the girl since, I don't have a clue who she is, don't have a clue.' His team had just suffered a 4-1 defeat at Mossley's Seel Park stadium in the final game of the season which was billed as a 'ladies day' to attract more female supporters. The face of the blonde fan cannot be seen in the close-up footage. Hart was sacked by the club, which play in Evo-Stik Division 1 North, within hours of the footage being shared to fans. His girlfriend Bryony Hibbert, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, who has two young children, slammed those responsible for filming and sharing the clip. Writing on the Clitheroe Football Club Facebook page, she said: 'Have a bit of decency for the people it's affected. Thank God my kids are too young to read. It's disgusting. I bet their families are far from perfect.' Striker Jay Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with blonde . One person who saw the film, which was shared on Twitter and Instagram, said Mr Hart was unaware he was being filmed at first. He said: 'The camera came round the dugout and there was a blonde female with her head down. The man couldn't see the camera because his eyes were closed. 'After a few seconds, he opened his eyes and laughed and the camera panned away again. I've been to Mossley AFC a few times and it's clearly their ground. The whole clip is only 10 to 15 seconds.' Mr Hart said he thinks of Ms Hibbert's  children as his own and hasn't seen them since the incident. His mother, Dawn Hart 46, also revealed Jay's younger sisters have been targeted by trolls, with someone sending the video to the youngest, aged nine. 'I know he's done wrong, but at the end of the day, he's my son and to see what people are saying about him, it's not nice,' she said. Mr Hart could be heard laughing on the mobile phone footage as he was caught romping with the mystery blonde . 'People have done a lot worse. Someone sent the video to my girls as well. 'They know something's gone on but they don't know what exactly, and to have to explain it to them when someone sends them something like that is horrible. 'It's had a knock on effect on his girls as well.' Clitheroe chairwoman Anne Barker said the player had 'brought the club into disrepute'. She said: 'I can't have somebody wearing the Clitheroe FC tracksuit bringing us down. 'It has brought the club into disrepute and it's not proper for him to scupper our reputation. I expect our players to act professionally. 'It was brought to my attention on Saturday night and dealt with through the management. I did offer to speak to him myself but Simon (Garner, the manager) said he would take care of it.' Mr Hart previously played for Colne FC and Padiham FC before joining Clitheroe, who currently sit 14th in the Evo-Stik League First Division North. First team manager Simon Garner, who signed Mr Hart, said: 'At the time of this unfortunate occurrence on Saturday, I wasn't there. I had already left the ground. 'I found out later on when I saw how it played out in Twitter. I'm disappointed but we can't control what the players do outside the time we are with them. 'They choose what they want to do. Unfortunately, Jason was wearing the club tracksuit and he knows he has let the club down, so the club has done what it has done. 'He's disappointed it has gone this far. It's going to have consequences for him beyond leaving this football club; with his family and possibly beyond that. 'Football is only a small part of it. If he had thought about what would have happened when he did it, he wouldn't have done it. He will pay for it. 'When I spoke to him, he sounded very apologetic about it. I'm disappointed for him.

This follows reports that British police have raised security levels ahead of  several World War I commemorative events taking place next week. Scroll down for video .

In the slick three-minute video, he sings: ‘In France deeds were done, in Germany the sleepers are waiting. ______ Oh Allah destroy them.’ German rapper turned Islamic State terrorist Denis Cuspert has released a music video threatening his home nation with a Charlie Hebdo-like atrocity .

Pictured is a grab from the video - a news footage clip of Paris attacker Amedy Coulibaly being shot by armed police . The video contains footage of passages from the Koran such as ‘kill the polytheists wherever you find them’ being highlighted, along with images of Western soldiers being treated in hospital and staged footage of bombs being assembled and guns being prepped. The number of Britons who have travelled to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS is twice than what has previously been reported. It is now thought that 1,600 Brits have joined ISIS, foreign intelligence officials told the Sunday Times. 'We believe that 1,600 is a very conservative estimate and we're seeing at least about five people leaving the UK for Syria anbd Iraq every week - and that's not to count the ones we don't know about,' an intelligence official said. According to the newspaper, about 500 have returned to the UK after heading to the Islamic State.

The paper said German and American intelligence sources confirmed the existence of the operation, Fox News reports.

In February it was revealed that the militant - who has starred in several grisly beheading videos for the Islamic State - was being spied on for the FBI by a Syrian woman he thought was his wife . German newspaper Bild believe Cuspert may have been targeted for the operation because of his womanising past. In Germany he fathered three children by three different women, including one who he dumped just before embarking on his career as an ISIS poster boy. Cuspert arrived in Syria in 2013 from a so-called German jihadi colony in Egypt. In February the US added rapper Cuspert to its list of 'global terrorists' - freezing all his assets under US control and prohibiting any transactions with him in the future. The State Department said: 'Cuspert is emblematic of the type of foreign recruit ISIL seeks for its ranks -– individuals who have engaged in criminal activity in their home countries who then travel to Iraq and Syria to commit far worse crimes against the people of those countries.' Last November, Cuspert was compared to Nazi Minister for Propaganda Joseph Goebbels for his ability to appeal to young, disillusioned people in Europe while providing an alternative ideology. He spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name 'Deso Dogg' before embracing radical Islam.

Troy University students Delonte' Martistee, 22, of Georgia and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, of Alabama were charged on Friday with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators relating to the incident that occurred between March 10-12, according to Bay County Sheriff's Office. According to WFSA, it has been confirmed by university officials that both men were suspended, and Martistee, a promising track star, has been removed from the team. ______ 'She knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened,' Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen said. Authorities  are still searching for two additional suspects in the case. Friday's charges stem from a video police found where hundreds of people are seen watching the incident without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim. The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama. Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim. McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing' and likened the scene to 'wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods'. Following the incident that occurred between March 10-12, the men were arrested and charged on Friday and were taken to the Bay County Jail as they await their first appearance . In the video, McKeithen said one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms. The incapacitated young woman is surrounded by several men while seated on a beach chair during the video filmed behind Spinnaker Beach Club. McKeithen told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped. 'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.' Authorities said hundreds of people walked past but did not stop the attack near Spinnaker Beach Club on Panama City Beach, Florida, in broad daylight during a Spring Break party last month . The sheriff's office said it has encountered incidents like this before through leads found on social media. In one video, police said a crowd pours beer on a girl who appears to be incapacitated while a male performs a sexual act on her. And recently, officers took inventory of the guns and drugs recovered during Spring Break this year which included marijuana, MDMA, cocaine, heroin as well as 49 handguns - which increased from nine last year. This most recent alleged sexual attack and the arrests made on Friday have served as a tipping point for the Bay County Sheriff's Office. McKeithen touted laws during Spring Break such as banning drinking on the beach and parking lots as well as clubs not being able to allow non-military people under 21 to enter. He said he will fight to have even more strict Spring Break regulations in the coming year. 'This draws the line in the sand for us,' he said. 'It is not safe for our children on the beach... If you condone this behavior, you should be in jail, as far as I'm concerned.'

The Wales and Lions wing has been removed from the firing line by his club ahead of the biggest game of their season to date following his third alarming head injury in the space of two months. The 22-year-old was knocked unconscious when struck by Wasps No 8 Nathan Hughes's knee as he was scoring a try at Franklin's Gardens last Friday night. Northampton have ruled out winger George North for the game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday . ______ Instead of merely abiding by the minimum, six-day return-to-play protocols, the Aviva Premiership champions have erred on the side of caution. 'In theory we could consider him,' said Jim Mallinder, Northampton's director of rugby. 'If it was his first one (head knock), then we would be considering him if he passed all the protocols and was available. Seeing as it's not his first, then it's the sensible thing to take specialist opinion. 'We won't play him at the weekend. Clearly he had a nasty knock. It was unfortunate. He did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time. We'll listen to what the neurologist says. He's the expert. As always we'll listen to his advice.' In Tuesday's Sportsmail, former Scotland full back Rory Lamont — who has suffered the after-effects of concussion injuries — called for the Welsh icon (left) to be rested for six months, saying: 'It's a complete disgrace that it has got to this stage. George has been let down.' He was not the only voice raising the alarm, but the Saints are aggrieved that distant observers are weighing in with comments without being completely aware of the specifics. Mallinder called for a calm, measured assessment of the situation. 'There's been lots of opinion over the last few days in particular,' he said. 'We've got to be careful that we don't blow anything out of proportion. 'It's a tough game. George has said that himself. We're always going to have incidents, but player welfare will always come first.There's a balance to it. We've got to make sure we don't get hysterical about it, but we are sensible. Clearly there are players who, if they've had a knock, need time off to make sure that their bodies recover. A head injury is no different to any other type of injury. 'You can't just stop people playing rugby. People who play the game understand that there are inherent dangers. 'Players are now very well looked after and I think it's probably not at the senior level where you need to worry. It's probably a little bit lower down, maybe schoolboys and junior rugby, where players don't get as well looked after as ours.' Nathan Hughes arrives late as North touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing's head . The Welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher . In reference to last Friday night's incident, Mallinder stressed that North had considerable medical support, in contrast to how it used to be in rugby — when attitudes were very different. 'It's something now in the game which has improved,' he added. 'It's brilliant. Straight after the incident the players recognised it (the severity of the injury). 'We've got two doctors available, physios available — and they know exactly what to do. 'It's not right, but I remember playing 30 years ago and your touch judge was the man who looked after you and basically you got a sponge on your head and you were back out if you could walk. 'Clearly the game is much improved for what we've got now. I'm not concerned for him (North). We've got to look after him.' On Tuesday night, Hughes was banned until April 28 for his 'reckless' actions — colliding with North when the try scorer was on the ground, unable to protect his head. The sanction has divided opinion, with Wasps players incensed by what they regard as an unduly heavy-handed punishment for an offence which the disciplinary panel accepted was not malicious. Asked if he had any sympathy with Hughes, Mallinder initially refused to comment, but added: 'I said at the time I think it was a red-card offence. I still do. 'Therefore the disciplinary process has taken place and that's what he's got. Meanwhile, Wasps will make a statement over whether they will appeal Hughes' ban.

And Barcelona's second of the night, in the 67th minute when Suarez stormed through, nutmegged David Luiz and finished, was their 400th goal in the competition. The landmark has been achieved in 202 matches since 1992 when the European Champions Clubs' Cup became the modern Champions League we know and love. The two goals scored by Luis Suarez against PSG took Barcelona past 400 Champions League goals . Barcelona have reached the landmark in 202 Champions League matches since 1992 . Barcelona won the quarter-final, first-leg match 3-1 to put themselves in control of the tie . Barcelona still have a little way to go before they catch Real Madrid's 436 Champions League goals. Table courtesy of Opta . However, Barcelona still have a some way to go to match the 436 goals scored in the competition by their great rivals Real Madrid. The Spanish giants are way out on top in the club scoring charts, with Bayern Munich coming in third with 349 goals and Manchester United fourth with 343. Over the Champions League years, Barcelona have found the net most against AC Milan (22), followed by Celtic and Chelsea on 18 apiece. They have scored 17 times against United, Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen. And it will come as little surprise that Argentine superstar Lionel Messi is way out in front in the breakdown of Barcelona Champions League scorers with 75, the joint-most in the tournament with Cristiano Ronaldo. Brazilian star Rivaldo comes in second with 22 goals, followed by Patrick Kluivert (20), Luis Enrique (19) and Samuel Eto'o (16). To mark Barcelona passing 400 Champions League goals, we take a look at some of the highlights. Barcelona 4 Manchester United 0 (1994-95 group stage) A United side hampered by a limit on foreign players had the misfortune to encounter Johan Cruyff's Barcelona 'Dream Team' at the wrong time. Hristo Stoichkov and Romario ran United's makeshift defence ragged in front of 114,000 fans, with the Bulgarian scoring twice and the Brazilian once before Albert Ferrer completed United's humiliation. Romario fires home Barcelona's second goal in their 1994 rout of Manchester United in the Nou Camp . Barcelona 5 Chelsea 1 (1999-2000 quarter-final, second leg) Leading 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea fancied their chances of getting through ahead of the return. Rivaldo's deflected free-kick and Luis Figo's goal had erased the deficit by half-time, though Tore Andre Flo put Chelsea back in the box seat. They were seven minutes from going through when Dani Garcia made it 3-1 and there was still time for Rivaldo to miss a penalty. Chelsea's defence crumbled in extra-time, another penalty, this time converted by Rivaldo, and a fifth from Patrick Kluivert carried Barcelona through. Luis Figo curls the ball home during Barcelona's 5-1 win over Chelsea in 2000 . Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1 (2006 final in Paris) The Champions League triumph that signalled the beginning of Barcelona's golden age. They needed two goals in the last 14 minutes to overcome the stubborn resistance of Arsenal, who had been reduced to 10 men when Jens Lehmann brought down Samuel Eto'o just 18 minutes in. The Gunners sensationally took the lead through Sol Campbell's thumping header eight minutes before half-time but couldn't hold out as Eto'o and Juliano Belletti sunk them late on. Captain Carles Puyol lifts the trophy with Ronaldinho after Barcelona's 2006 win over Arsenal . Barcelona 4 Bayern Munich 0 (2008-09 quarter-final, first leg) Pep Guardiola's star-studded team showed their Champions League-winning potential with this demolition of Bayern in which all four goals came before half-time. In no mood to hang around, Lionel Messi opened the scoring after nine minutes and Eto'o added another three minutes later. A second from Messi and another from Thierry Henry essentially settled the two-legged contest before half-time. Thierry Henry salutes Samuel Eto'o after rounding off Barcelona's 4-0 rout of Bayern Munich in 2009 . Barcelona 2 Manchester United 0 (2009 final in Rome) Sir Alex Ferguson's team were going for their second Champions League triumph in a row and had beaten Barcelona in the 2008 semi-finals. Guardiola's team had other ideas and exacted revenge thanks to a 10th-minute opener from Eto'o and Messi's clincher 20 minutes from time. It was Barcelona's midfield partnership of Xavi and Andres Iniesta that ran the game. Lionel Messi (left) and Andres Iniesta parade the European Cup after the 2009 win over Manchester United . Barcelona 4 Arsenal 1 (2009-10 quarter-final, second leg) One of Messi's finest performances as the maestro scored four times to demolish Arsenal's Champions League hopes. With the last-eight tie locked at 2-2 from the first leg, the Nou Camp was stunned when Nicklas Bendtner scored a precious away goal on 18 minutes. From then on, it was a one-man show. Messi had equalised within three minutes and had Barcelona in control with another couple before the break, including a sumptuous lob. A fourth late on made it an emphatic win. Messi scored four times as Barcelona demolished Arsenal in a 2010 quarter-final . Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 2 (2010-11 Semi-final, first leg) This Clasico semi-final in 2011 was a dream come true for all football fans and it was Messi and Barcelona that kept their cool as tempers frayed. Real hothead Pepe was sent off in the 61st minute and boss Jose Mourinho sent to the Bernabeu stands shortly afterwards for protesting. Cue Messi to seize control, turning home Ibrahim Afellay's cross and then setting off on a 30-yard run to score the second. Barcelona pile on Messi after his goal in the Bernabeu semi-final back in 2011 . Barcelona 3 Manchester United 1 (2011 final at Wembley) Barcelona were unquestionably the best team in Europe at this time and another final triumph over United confirmed this. At Wembley, Pedro gave them the lead in the 27th minute, only for Wayne Rooney to level shortly afterwards. But Barca were by far the better team, dominating possession, and it came as little surprise when Messi fired home at the start of the second half. David Villa made sure 20 minutes from time as Barca claimed a third European Cup in five years. Pep Guardiola is thrown into the air by Barcelona after their 2011 final win over Manchester United . Barcelona 7 Bayer Leverkusen 1 (2011-12 last 16, second leg) Messi raised his game to even greater heights, becoming the first player to score five goals in a Champions League fixture in this seven-goal drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen. Leading 3-1 from the first leg in Germany, there was little pressure on Barca and their domination was exemplified by their 865 passes in the game to the German side's 217. Many of them found their way to Messi, who scored twice before half-time and added another three after. Messi slots home his fourth goal in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 . Manchester City 0 Barcelona 2 (2013-14 last 16, first leg) City desperately wanted to make a statement on the European stage but Barcelona had other ideas in this clinical away performance. The decisive moment came in the 54th minute when Messi was fouled by Martin Demichelis, who was sent off. Messi dusted himself down to convert the penalty and Dani Alves delivered a late second after swapping passes with Neymar.

That he recorded a relatively respectable score — some significant distance off the lead, but certainly in the ball park of what would have been considered a reasonable number given that this was his first competitive golf for two months — was testament to his cussedness as much as his talent. Tiger dug deep and his play around the greens saved him. It was remarkable, really, considering his crisis of confidence. On the sixth, a par three, Woods missed the green again. He looked more than irritated, he looked worn down, fed up with a sport he once held on a string. He no doubt remembers how it used to be, too. How he must miss that old Tiger. He walked to the ball, perched at the top of a small incline to the right of the green. And he putted it. Rolled it down the slope, got it near enough. Settled. But, even so, it was a tell. The best poker players don’t have tells and Tiger likes Las Vegas as much as any high roller. But he saw his hand and, on that occasion, he blinked. It was still a Tiger gallery, of course. Still the biggest, still primed to applaud even the tiniest glimmer of his genius. But they would have recognised this as Tiger bluffing. Rewind through a decade and he would have conjured something small and miraculous with a short iron, made the ball pitch and spit and stop almost at his command. He would have shown the mastery of a charmer with a mesmerised snake. ______ Sure, they’re part of the game and every pro relies on them, even the all-time greats. But he was coming to need them, more and more. He won’t be entirely comfortable with that. He couldn’t putt at the 11th, when he again missed right and left himself a rascal of a chip. If Tiger’s short game was as bad as it had looked last time, the ball could easily have taken a bath. Instead, he recovered, just like old times. Then put it in the water at the 12th instead. Golf’s gods thumbed their noses and pulled faces behind his back. ‘I made two dumb mistakes,’ said Woods. ‘That apart, it was a good day. The short game was my strength, it was the reason I worked my butt off — to make it my strength again.’ Even so, dramatic saves weren’t all the old Tiger was about. There was a shot on the seventh that would have been a contender for play of the day. That is why they continue to hurry when he has played, no matter the needs of his patient partners. Tiger hits and off they go to see Tiger hit again. But Tiger is hitting more and more. Not the 82 times he hit at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in January perhaps, but more times than he would have hit in such benign conditions at Augusta in the old days, when he wouldn’t have been so pleased to tie for 41st place after 18 holes. Still, the seventh. Boy it was a beauty. He was behind a tree, left of the fairway, barely in sight of the green. He took a giant hit, dug it out but with such power and ferocity. The crowd lost the flight, the cameraman too, but Woods didn’t. He skipped and peered around the forestry to see the ball drop out of the sky, onto the green to a Sunday afternoon reception. Momentarily it was 1997 all over again. And then it was 2015 again and he left his 25 footer short. Par. Woods was not impressed with his approach shot to the 10th, but he managed to salvage par on the hole . Woods' beau Lindsey Vonn was in attendance as her other half mopped his sopping brow with a towel . Woods, Jimmy Walker and Jamie Donaldson walk to the 6th green during an absorbing day's play . Increasingly, his gallery writes cheques the man in the arena cannot cash. They were 14 rows deep just to watch him walk the ten strides from putting green to first tee. Eight on one side, six on the other, five marshals, wrestling with rope, and several baseball-hatted G4 security men. A local sheriff marched past, perspiring through his regulation white shirt. Even for Augusta in April it was unseasonably warm: 89, according to the Weather Channel. It was approaching 1.48pm Eastern Time. Tiger o’clock. The 14 rows fidgeted expectantly. Tiger breezed through, to applause, cheers and the odd whoop; the love of the common people. He nodded in appreciation once, mouthed a noiseless thank you, smiled a tight anti-smile. And then he was gone. Swallowed up as the ropes dropped and the crowd fell in behind him. Will he, won’t he? Could he, couldn’t he? They had seen the man, but would they ever see The Man? He was coming here with a new game, and a new mindset, but was this a new Tiger? Woods lines up his putt on the par three sixth as the 15-time major winner had a solid start to the day . Woods shows his fury at a chip from a bunker on the fourth,  but he managed to steady the ship . Woods patrols the Augusta fairways on a largely frustrating round for the former world No 1 . No. Not a new Tiger like the old Tiger anyway. Too much, too soon. He was better than the Tiger that departed Torrey Pines in February, with fears for his long-term future. Better for all that graft, that sun up to sun down perseverance. But he was still the 111th ranked golfer in the world. A bit rusty, a bit erratic, a bit brilliant, a bit fallible. There were fine moments, but they were fleeting. He got better through the round, but he would have eaten this place alive in the good old days. And that is Tiger’s problem. It’s a bit like Al Pacino in Carlito’s Way. Every time he tries to get out, they pull him back in. The creaks, the chunks, the odd crisis of confidence that just wasn’t there before. He starts to get going, he works his ass off, but it is hard. He three-putted the first, birdied the second. Hit a tree off the tee on the third, but got a lucky kick onto the fairway. Found a bunker, then missed the green on the par three fourth, played a quite stunning second from a poor fairway lie on the fifth. It was the golf of a competitor still battling against the years, and the aches of a creaking back and — whisper it — maybe yips that could resurface at any time. He won’t go quietly, the competitor remains, but he is vulnerable now. If it is isn’t one thing, it’s the other. Woods wills his second shot from the 14th on with the galleries gripped on the unfolding soap opera . Woods looks anxiously as his tee shot from the 15th sails into the still Georgia skies on a perfect day for golf . Woods finished the day at one over as he looks forlornly at a shot on the eighth .","Putting from off the green? That was for the old guys and the also-rans, those without the bravery or the genius to make the ball obey. So Tiger got it close and made the solid up and down.","This passage is quite detailed and thought-provoking. Let's break it down and analyze what it says about Tiger Woods.

Tiger Woods' effort in this round of golf updates his well-documented struggles with his short game. He chipped, drove, and putted with remarkable skill and eagerness, demonstrating that he still possesses greatness within him. However, it seems that his confidence and composure are slightly subdued in this particular round.

Throughout the 15th hole, Tiger showed flashes of great dry spell, settling into a boring routine and unnecessary frustration for problems through focused clutch putts making it to the 12th green.

Brook, who defeated Jo Jo Dan to retain his IBF welterweight title last month, immediately challenged Khan in a post-fight interview but the Bolton-born boxer has instead agreed a bout on May 30, with his opponent yet to be confirmed. Khan has reiterated his intention to take on Brook within the next 12 months, although he insists that the undefeated 28-year-old only wants the fight because of the money it will earn him. Amir Khan (left), pictured during his last fight against Devon Alexander, has blasted Kell Brook's motives . Brook (right) shakes hands with British Superbike champion Shane Byrne at Donington Park on Tuesday . In an interview with iFL TV, Khan said: 'He's only faced one decent opponent in his whole career, so he has no room to talk. It seems to me that he's just calling me out for that one big payday. ______ Brook is desperate to fight Khan but his fellow Brit rejected the chance to face him at Wembley in June . A £5million clash with Brook at Wembley on June 13 was also an option but Khan rejected the offer as he will not fight during Ramadan because of his Islamic faith. He added: 'Like I said, this Algieri fight, if it happens, it's making me a lot of money; money that Kell Brook's not seen. That's why he's probably dying. Amir's making millions when he's not even seen his first million. 'There's classes in boxing. There's fighters in boxing who are the A-class fighters, the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Mayweather, who talk about and mention and say they know who Amir Khan is. 'When it comes to Kell Brook, who knows Kell Brook in America? Which fighter, apart from Shawn Porter, knows Kell Brook? Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao don't know who Kell Brook is, so I don't know what he's going on about trying to say he's a big name. 'Kell Brook's going on like he's the next guy to fight Mayweather when he's not even a big ticket seller. He might be big in his own backyard in Sheffield, but other than Sheffield, no-one knows him. Brook is hoping to fight Khan within the next 12 months as he looks to extend his unbeaten streak . Khan claims that Brook is not even a big name in the UK and is not able to face the world's biggest names . 'The way he's tried to come across to the US public is like he's a super-big name in the UK. He's not a big name in the UK.' And Khan insists that he is not avoiding Brook, even though the fight will be of greater benefit to the Sheffield-born star. 'Look, do I need the fight against Kell Brook?,' said Khan. 'I make a lot of money regardless if I fight Kell Brook. 'I will make a lot of money in this sport and I've made a lot of money in this sport of boxing. Kell Brook needs me to make that big money. 'Without me, he'll never make that big money unless he goes out and fights the top guys like Pacquiao, Mayweather, and Marquez, but I can't see him fighting those guys because he's always scared to get beat by them and lose his title.'","'If he keeps going on like this, that one big payday fight for him will never happen because at the end of the day, he's just trying to win fans over by mentioning my name when he knows that I can't fight then because of Ramadan. 'And he's putting down my opponents, who are still better opponents than his opponents, like Jo Jo Dan, who should be called No No Dan, to be honest with you, because end of day, he's not done anything in his career.'

Swindon’s win over Peterborough meant Steve Cotterill will have to wait until Tuesday to finish the job of returning to the Championship, but almost as importantly they made sure Preston wouldn’t make any ground on them in the top two. Three points at Bradford on Tuesday will do the trick - only that standing in their way now. It would take something to go seriously awry for the Robins not to be returning to the second tier after a two-year absence, and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west. Bristol City striker Aaron Wilbraham celebrates his 63rd minute goal against Preston at Deepdale . Preston (3-5-2): Johnstone; Clarke, King, Wright; Humphrey (Wiseman 84), Welsh, Johnson, Gallagher, Laird; Beckford (Davies 90), Garner (Robinson 84) Subs not used: Stuckmann, Kilkenny, Woods, Little . Bristol City (3-5-2): Fielding, Ayling, Flint, Williams; Tavernier, K.Smith, Pack, Freeman (Elliott 90), Bryan; Agard (Emmanuel-Thomas 82), Wilbraham . Subs not used: Richards, Cunningham, Osborne, Saville, Wagstaff . A six-minute rendition of ‘F*** off Swindon Town, you are staying down’ rang out of the gleeful away end at Deepdale - populated by 2,400 - as that return got ever closer. City had dispensed of their rivals on Tuesday night, hammering them 3-0, and took great delight in revelling in their triumph. It was an afternoon whereby neither side played with any nerves - there are reasons why these two occupy the automatic promotion places - although lacking a fluidity you would perhaps expect. There was an illusion of this being an open game, but the two five-man midfields shattered that. Jermaine Beckford came closest for the hosts, his smart overhead kick just flying wide, while the out of sorts Daniel Johnson blasted way over. Joe Garner felt he should’ve been awarded a penalty after being clattered by Frank Fielding. Steve Cotterill, knowing results elsewhere dictated they could still clinch elevation by five o’clock, clearly put a rocket up his free scorers at the break. Before then they had threatened from free-kicks, managed to get into decent positions, but didn’t threaten nearly enough. ______ That was until Jermaine Beckford popped up, five yards out, to send Deepdale delirious just before the hour mark. Paul Gallagher picked up on lapse defending to take control of the situation inside the away box, firing across goal for Beckford to sweep beyond Fielding. At that stage, it took Simon Grayson’s side seven points ahead of MK Dons - drawing at Port Vale - in third. But they only managed to hold the lead for four minutes, Aden Flint intelligently flicking a header towards the middle of the six-yard box for Wilbraham to power home in front of the travelling band from the West Country, his 20th of the season. Grayson will be frustrated at the way in which his side switched off from a routine set piece. This could’ve been a day they made the title race very interesting indeed. As it was, Agard forced Johnstone into another decent save, diving down to his right to tip wide on the angle, as Cotterill’s side searched for a winner. That did not come, despite substitute Jay Emmanuel-Thomas’ best efforts. The ice is stored away, but not for long.","Wilbraham got on the end of James Tavernier’s wicked cross from the right, but his shot was superbly tipped onto the bar by Sam Johnstone. Kieran Agard failed to stretch far enough to convert from two yards shortly afterwards. Preston were on the ropes, their biggest crowd in two years growing restless immediately after half-time.","The blank denoted by ""3"".",0.7853585482,0.7574278116,0.771140337,0.064516129,0.0,0.064516129,0.064516129

Jermaine Beckford's 10th goal in his past 19 appearances and Callum Robinson's effort had put North End two goals up, but Jermaine McGlashan and Legge left the Deepdale faithful despondent. Across Lancashire, MK Dons closed the gap on Simon Grayson's men to three points as Lewis Baker, Will Grigg and Dele Alli were on target in the 3-0 victory over Fleetwood. Jermaine Beckford scored his 10th goal of the season as Preston were held 2-2 by Gillingham . Swindon remain in the automatic promotion hunt too following a 4-2 win at Rochdale, who have still never beaten the Robins at Spotland. A hat-trick from Ben Gladwin and Michael Smith's strike had put Swindon 4-0 ahead before Ian Henderson's penalty and Nathan Thompson's own goal prevented the hosts from suffering a thrashing. Dale fell seven points behind Chesterfield as they strengthened their grip on the final play-off spot by hammering Colchester 6-0. Gary Roberts and Sam Clucas both claimed doubles and Dan Gardner and Jimmy Ryan also found the net to give the Spireites breathing room in sixth position. At the other end of the table, Crewe were the only one of the sides on 47 points to pick up anything, with a 1-1 draw at Peterborough enough to move them out of the bottom four. Lauri Dalla Valle's goal had put the Alex ahead before Conor Washington's equaliser stopped Steve Davis' side earning three points on the road. Crawley replaced the Railwaymen in the relegation zone as they were thumped 5-0 by Walsall, Jordy Hiwula bagging a brace and Kieron Morris, Andy Taylor and Jordan Cook all scoring too. Rob Jones' header gave Doncaster a 1-0 triumph over Leyton Orient, and while the O's avoided slipping into the bottom four, they were joined on 47 points by Notts County. ______ Already relegated Yeovil claimed a first win of the Paul Sturrock era as Stephen Arthurworrey got the winner in a 1-0 success over fifth-placed Sheffield United.

Sherwood is renowned for his fiery displays on the touchline, so how did he fare during what is undoubtedly one of the more emotive fixtures for him? Sportsmail explains... Tim Sherwood was visibly delighted at recording a victory with Aston Villa against Tottenham . CROWD REACTION . All was going well until his exuberant celebrations at the final whistle, which prompted an angry reaction from the home fans in the West Stand but he merely shook his fist at them and disappeared down the tunnel. Got an easy ride during the game, though, as the overmatched Vlad Chiriches bore the brunt of the home crowd's frustration before he was hooked in the 78th minute. Gave the Villa fans a wave after they asked for one in the 16th minute. Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches (left) bore the brunt of the home fans' dismay against Villa . TOUCHLINE BEHAVIOUR . The bright spring day in N17 allowed to him leave his gillet indoors so there were no flying jackets this time. He did not leave his seat until the eighth minute then remained standing for the most part. Little more than a subtle fist pump when Christian Benteke scored what proved to be the winner but his emotions poured out at the final whistle.

Sherwood coud not resist a lively celebration when the final whistle confirmed the victory for Villa .

Very little on this front with Tony Parks, who was one of his lieutenants here at Spurs, doing most of the talking.

Sherwood (centre) celebrated in a subdued manner when Benteke's header found the back of the net . ______ Like he did here with Emmanuel Adebayor, Sherwood has shown once again that he knows how to get a striker scoring. Christian Benteke, who fronted a three-pronged attack, scored the winner before the manager set his side up perfectly to deal with the second half Spurs fight back, although it never seemed to come. Benteke points to the sky in celebration after hitting the back of the net for Villa at Tottenham . Sherwood has helped Belgium striker Benteke rediscover his scoring form since taking over .

He played 90 minutes in Monday's 2-1 loss against Crystal Palace but picked up a hamstring injury at Selhurst Park and Pellegrini said he is doubtful for the match against Louis van Gaal's men. 'Kompany we will assess tomorrow,' he said. 'He worked the whole week the normal way. I always say the same. We are always better with Kompany but if he cannot play we have a squad.' If Kompany is deemed unfit City could be facing a defensive crisis with Dedryck Boyata also injured.

City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists he does not fear for his job, despite his team dropping into fourth . City are in fourth place, a point behind United, after losing three of their last five Premier League matches and taking 18 points from 36 since the turn of the year. Some have speculated that Pellegrini could face the sack at the end of the season. When asked if he was worried about his future he said: 'I don't think so. I am not talking about my future because it's not important. I'm just thinking about the game against Manchester United.' However, he added: 'You never know what will happen in August. if you ask me I am not afraid because I think we are in a bad moment . 'We are not a disaster, we are not a mess. We are doing a lot of things well.' City, who will also be without strike pair Stevan Jovetic (muscle injury) and Wilfried Bony (ankle and knee), will be going for five straight derby wins for the first time in their history against third-placed United who are a point in front. But Pellegrini refused to say that they were now the biggest club in Manchester. Eliaquim Mangala (left) could be set to replace Kompany in the team to take on United on Sunday . Strikers Stevan Jovetic (left) and Wilfried Bony are already out of the Manchester derby through injury . 'I don't like to compare,' he said. 'Our target is not to compare but to improve in our project. Pellegrini added that his men were still using a certain ex-United manager as motivation.

The recorded cell phone conversation, which the company released to reporters, shows John Hargrove using the N-word seven times while talking on the phone with a female friend. In the five-minute video, Hargrove discusses an incident in which  five black men allegedly threw a rock at the woman speaking on the other line that she said hit the back of her head. Hargrove, who also featured prominently in the CNN documentary Blackfish, says SeaWorld is mounting a smear campaign against him in an attempt to distract from his message. Scroll down for video . SeaWorld has released an almost five-year-old video depicting ex-trainer John Hargrove repeatedly using the N-word, just days after his book criticizing the company's treatment of animals launched . The recorded cell phone conversation, which the company released to reporters, shows Hargrove using the N-word seven times while talking on the phone with a female friend . 'You know you were mad, cause you whipped around and you said that, you did, ""What are you n****rs doing throwing them rocks? ""', he can be heard saying, a glass of wine in front of him. 'Didn't you think it was risky to say that to those five n****rs? ', he asks the girl, who denies during the conversation that she spoke those words. 'How much did you drink tonight, my god,' she then says. Three bottles of wine can be seen on the table during the video. During the video Hargrove, who was a trainer at SeaWorld for 14 years, tells his friend 'I've been drinking so much,' as he and the person behind the camera continue to laugh hysterically at their friend on the phone. SeaWorld spokesman Fred Jacobs said the company was given the video by an 'internal whistle-blower' last weekend and that his employment would have been terminated 'immediately' if they had known 'he engaged in this kind of behavior.' 'We are offended by John's behavior and language. The video is particularly reprehensible since John Hargrove is wearing a SeaWorld shirt,' Jacobs said in an email. Hargrove was a trainer at SeaWorld for 14 years and spoke out against the company in the highly critical documentary Blackfish . SeaWorld has also publicly claimed that Hargrove quit the company after he was disciplined for a 'severe safety violation involving the park's killer whales'. Hargrove spoke out against SeaWorld in the highly critical documentary Blackfish, which has left the company reeling with declining revenue and attendance. And last week he released a book detailing his long career with the once-popular park, titled Beneath The Surface. Hargrove quickly struck back after the video was released, saying SeaWorld was digging up dirt to make him 'look like this awful person'. 'What's so amazing, they're not addressing the issues at hand,' he told the Orlando Sentinel. 'This is about killer whales in captivity.' Hargrove told U-T San Diego that he had never seen the video and did not remember the incident. He also said he had been with another SeaWorld employee that night and 'had a lot to drink'. 'These are all just personal attacks to try to slander me and my character,' he said. 'These are petty, childish attempts to discredit somebody.' The NAACP issued a statement following the video's release and said Hargrove's repeated use of the N-word 'calls into question his judgement and his credibility'. 'It is difficult to accept his authority on animal welfare issues if he does not treat fellow humans with dignity and respect,' it states. The video's release also caused one San Diego bookstore to cancel Hargrove's book signing after the store received an email from SeaWorld with a link to the clip. None of Hargrove's other scheduled appearances have been canceled. Hargrove is currently on tour promoting Beneath The Surface, which recounts the 'devastating effects of captivity' he said he saw while working with killer whales as he became higher-ranked within the company, the ex-trainer told NPR. Hargrove struck back after the video was released, and said SeaWorld was trying to make him 'look like this awful person'. He also said he had 'a lot to drink' when the video was recorded and did not recall the incident . In the book, Hargrove said he was especially affected after seeing SeaWorld separate 19 mother killer whales from their calves, which he claims is done through trickery. He also claims he saw trainers hold back food from the whales. Hargrove  also fought back at SeaWorld's claim that he violated the company's safety rules. He said he was disciplined because he waited a day to inform his supervisors that another employee had improperly locked a gate at Shamu Stadium, even though he had immediately pointed out the mistake. Hargrove said he was 'punished' and was temporarily moved to the sea-lion stadium, but he then immediately went on medical leave for knee injuries before quitting the company entirely. SeaWorld's fight against Hargrove comes just a week after the company launched a new advertising campaign in attempts to fight the backlash it has received since the premiere of Blackfish. The company claimed the advertisement's close timing with the release of Hargrove's book was unrelated. ______ Last week SeaWorld also launched its 'Meet the Animals' YouTube campaign, which introduces individual animals in the company's various parks.","The campaign focuses on the park's efforts of caring for animals in captivity and in the wild, while 'setting the record straight on false accusations by activists who oppose whales and other animals in zoological settings', the company stated. Print advertisements will appear in the likes of The New York Times, The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal.","They were on the road after Hargrove's outspoken defense of Blackfish and an open apology for SeaWorld after the release of an almost five-year-old video that showed Hargrove using an N-word, the now-released video of him conversing with a friend about using N-word.",0.8171375394,0.8294146657,0.8232303262,0.1666666667,0.0188679245,0.1481481481,0.1481481481

The Ibrox board last week launched a probe into claims Mike Ashley’s firm had taken ownership of intellectual property, including the club’s famous crests. However, they are satisfied the position stems solely from the security attached to the loan from Sports Direct, accepted by the former regime in January. ‘It has been widely reported that the trademarks, the iconic symbols of our club, are now in the possession of Sports Direct,’ said a club statement. ‘Although the trademarks are registered in Sports Direct’s name, the position is not as alarming as it may first appear. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is a divisive figure north and south of the border . ______ Both parties will come together within the next two weeks for talks. ‘Confusion over ownership arose last week when it was noticed on a Government Intellectual Property site that they appeared to be the possessions of Sports Direct but this was as a consequence of the loan facility entered into by the previous board.

A veteran of 63 Test matches, Benaud played a pivotal role in the formation of World Series Cricket in the 1970s and was one of the world's most recognised commentators. In a broadcast career spanning more than five decades, he was instrumental in establishing one-day cricket on television. Masses of Australian cricketers, politicians and sportspeople penned heartfelt tributes on social media in the wake of his passing.

Benaud was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets yet was as much renowned for his captaincy - he never lost a Test series as Australian captain. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia. He was the mainstay in Australian cricket television commentary until the past two summers - a car accident in 2013 sidelined him before he announced in November last year he had skin cancer.

In the week that Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling spoke about his unwillingness to agree a new contract at Anfield, Pellegrini’s comments suggest that City may look to invest heavily in other teams’ homegrown talent this summer. Premier League regulations require clubs to carry at least eight homegrown players, which can include youngsters who have spent three of their formative years at an English club. FA chairman Greg Dyke is pushing for the figure to be raised to 12. Manuel Pellegrini says the academy players at Manchester City are not ready for the first team . Pellegrini's assertions may mean City buy English players like Raheem Sterling to reach homegrown quotas . Everton's England international midfield player Ross Barkley has also been linked with City . But the lack of suitable candidates emerging from Patrick Vieira’s academy means City’s only option will be to buy in the bulk of their quota, with the defending league champions also linked with Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Ross Barkley of Everton. City’s current group of home-grown players will be reduced in the summer when Frank Lampard departs and it could be further depleted if James Milner, who wants guarantees of more regular first-team football, opts to leave. Coincidentally, Liverpool is Milner’s most likely destination should he leave but the prospect of Sterling moving in the opposite direction has been increased to the point that bookmakers rate City his most likely destination next season. City’s youth system has come under fire in recent seasons for its lack of productivity. Belgian defender Dedryck Boyata, who has started nine league games in nearly six years at City, is the only former academy player anywhere near first-team contention. Pellegrini said: ‘We must be patient with the academy. Young players are important. Maybe it’s not so easy for young players, especially at big clubs, to play in the first team, with the professional squad. But I’m sure in the future we will have very important players coming from the academy. James Milner could leave City in the summer with Liverpool a potential destination . Arsenal midfield player Jack Wilshere has also been linked with a transfer to City . Defender Dedryck Boyata (right) is City's only academy player near first-team contention . ‘But it’s important to have years of working the same way. But you never know. Maybe some talented young players can do it soon.’ Sterling would fit the bill, if his impasse at Liverpool proves unsolvable, although Pellegrini refused to comment directly about the Liverpool and England forward. Pellegrini said: ‘I think it’s important for big clubs to bring in the best players, that’s the most important thing. If they’re all good players, of course I agree with the quota. All the big leagues — especially the Premier League — need the best players to play.’ City’s homegrown quota is made up of Boyata, Lampard, Milner, Joe Hart, reserve keeper Richard Wright and Gael Clichy, who qualifies from his years spent with Arsenal. They are joined by four academy players — Thierry Ambrose, George Glendon, Jose Angel Tasende and Jose Angel Pozo, although Spaniard Pozo is the only one to have been near the first team this season. A number of young City professionals, including John Guidetti at Celtic, PSV’s Karim Rekik and Marcos Lopes with Lille, are on loan and may be brought back to plug some of the holes next season, although a big investment in English talent via the transfer market seems the only option. Frank Lampard helps make up City's homegrown quota but is leaving for New York at the end of the season . Patrick Vieira is overseeing the City academy's production of youth and homegrown players . Striker John Guidetti is on loan at Celtic but could return to meet quota regulations next season .

Sunderland were the better team here. They were superior in terms of energy and creativity against a Newcastle side rather inexcusably playing — to use the term their manager hates — with their ‘flip-flops on’ once again. Nothing Dick Advocaat’s home team did, however, was anywhere near as exquisite as the goal that won this contest for them. It was a goal seemingly taken from another day and dropped haphazardly right into the middle of a match that didn’t really deserve it.

Jermain Defoe gave Sunderland a 1-0 lead with this brilliant volley - CLICK HERE to see more from our brilliant Match Zone service . Only seconds remained in the first half when Sunderland’s earnest but limited centre forward Steven Fletcher leapt to head a long pass from his own goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon towards Jermain Defoe. Still 25 yards out, the former England striker must have thought about bringing the ball under control. He had players arriving in support on either side. It would have been the sensible thing to do. True goalscorers have a mindset that is always switched to ‘glory’, though, and instead of taking the pragmatic route, Defoe decided to buy a ticket for the raffle. Moments after swinging his left foot at the ball he looked up to see it sail over Tim Krul in the Newcastle goal. All of a sudden, he was holding the winning ticket. On a weekend of sensational goals, this was another born of perfect technique, ambition and courage. It deserved to win a game that Sunderland deserved to win and it is up to the rest of Advocaat’s players to ensure it contributes to a run of results that keeps them in the Barclays Premier League.

Just what is it that eats the modern Newcastle? Dressed in grey, they didn’t even look like a Newcastle team. Did they play like one? Sadly, they did. Newcastle have been churning out rubbish like this for far too long now and it is depressing to report that it is becoming the norm. Sunderland were much improved, unrecognisable from the side who conceded four in the first half here against Aston Villa recently. That day, half of the Sunderland supporters were back in their cars by half-time. Here, under a new manager, Sunderland were comfortably better than local opposition who seem to head into derby games expecting to lose.

Krul (left) seems to share a joke with Defoe shortly after the Black Cats forward beat him with a wonderful volley . It was difficult to understand for long periods what Newcastle were actually trying to do. If they were trying to suffocate the game then for a while it worked. Once they got caught, though, they seemed to possess neither the wit nor the willpower to find a way back. Sunderland were not always convincing early on. ______ A Billy Jones cut-back from a corner to the far post was cut out by Jonas Gutierrez in the 10th minute,, while Jordi Gomez struck a low free-kick at Krul and Connor Wickham’s header was deflected wide by Moussa Sissoko, the Newcastle captain. Prior to the goal, however, Sunderland’s play in the final third had been rather unconvincing. Had Newcastle possessed any forward thrust at all, they might have found a way into the game. But once Defoe’s left foot brought the Stadium of Light to its feet, Sunderland rarely appeared in any danger. Another goal would have settled their nerves and they had opportunities. Indeed, they looked more dangerous in the second half. Former Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback (right) fouls Wickham during a ferocious second half display . Sammy Ameobi (right) is closed down by Sebastian Larsson and Billy Jones during the Premier League clash . Sunderland's Steven Fletcher (centre) is beaten in the air by Newcastle midfielder Jonas Gutierrez . Fletcher, though, has never been a goalscorer who has scored many goals — spot the contradiction? — and twice he failed here. A header on the hour needed more power to beat Krul and then another chance, provided by Defoe’s low cross, was spurned on the back of a decision to pivot away from goal and shoot on the turn rather than drive towards goal on his right side. We should not be too hard on Fletcher. He works as hard as any. The difference between a journeyman and an international of standing was evident, though, and Advocaat will be glad that predecessor Gus Poyet at least left him with a striker of pedigree before he was run out of town last month.Sebastian Larsson also failed in front of goal as the clock ticked on while, belatedly, Newcastle found a little something. Pantilimon was finally asked to work when Remy Cabella shot from 18 yards in the 78th minute before Ayoze Perez volleyed over from a corner at the death. That, in truth, was a real chance. A draw, though, would have been a joke. Newcastle manager John Carver admitted afterwards that his team had embarrassed him and it’s not the first time. When the final whistle blew, Defoe — substituted with 12 minutes left — wore a smile as wide as the river and with good reason.

The former world No 1 has started just two events in 2015, shooting a career-worst score of 82 to miss the cut in the first of them and withdrawing through injury after just 11 holes of the second on February 5.

For the first time in 88 years the women’s race was staged on the famous Tideway course that for so long had been the sole preserve of the men. Hot favourites Oxford romped to victory by six and a half lengths against Cambridge, as the women struck a telling blow for sporting equality in racing the same championship course on the same day as the men. Ansastaia Chitty lifts the trophy aloft after Oxford won the boat race, easing past Cambridge on the Thames . On the day the Oxford sides shared the race route for the first time, they also shared the exact same winning margin, with the men going on to triumph in their race shortly afterwards. Oxford women’s president Anastasia Chitty hailed the victory as a special moment for her crew, but also for rowing and sporting equality overall. ‘It’s an amazing moment,’ Chitty told BBC Sport. ‘To pull something off like that is amazing. ‘To row on the same stage as the men, there were so many women before us who have never had this opportunity and it’s extremely humbling. We started moving away early on and kept ourselves ahead.’ The Oxford crew celebrate their win over Cambridge after dominating the race from start to finish . As the most decorated Olympic athlete ever to race in either boat race, Oxford stroke Caryn Davies underlined the quality on display in the women’s contest. The 32-year-old US Olympics team star boasts silver at Athens and gold medals at Beijing and London in the women’s eight — and now a boat race victory to boot. ‘I think that’s harder, I’ve got to be honest,’ Davies told BBC Sport when asked how the boat race compared to Olympic competition. The Oxford women's crew power to their win in the first women's boat race on the river Thames . ‘There was almost three times as long to suffer. But there’s always less suffering when you win! I’m just proud and honoured to have such attention. It shows how excited people are and I’m so glad we can be role models to young women everywhere.’ Oxford women finished in 19 minutes 45 seconds — 19 seconds ahead of Cambridge. Davies added: ‘I could just hear so many people cheering along the banks and it didn’t matter it they were cheering for Oxford or Cambridge. ______ ‘There were some pretty dark moments going in but I’m so pleased for the guys. We just stuck to our plan and executed a great race. ‘This was a fantastic performance. It is a relief to win as we were firm favourites. ‘Rio remains the long-term goal but this race was so important for me and all of us.’ They were true to form, surging ahead from the start. Despite being quickly pegged back, they powered ahead during the middle section to dominate the race, finishing in 17 minutes 34 seconds — winning by 19 seconds as Oxford’s women had before them. Crew member Michael DiSanto added: ‘We knew what we needed to do and we wanted to go down as one of the best Oxford crews ever.’ Louloudis lauded the achievements of the women’s boat on such a landmark occasion. ‘This was an historic day and there is no reason not to be optimistic for the sport going forward,’ he said. The Cambridge crew kept going to the end but they were outclassed, eventually losing by over six lengths .","Just that they turned out was really great for us.’ After Oxford’s women breezed to victory, their male counterparts made it a Dark Blue double with victory in the 161st men’s race by an identical six and a half lengths. President Constantine Louloudis claimed a fourth and final boat race victory, completing a clean sweep only interrupted by claiming bronze with Team GB’s men’s eight at London 2012. The dark blues made a fast start and dominated the race against their Cambridge counterparts . Louloudis hailed the victory — Oxford’s 11th in the last 15 years — and admitted he felt far more pressure than before, despite his three previous wins. ‘I felt much more pressure this year, especially as I was leaving the guys,’ Louloudis told BBC Sport.","Based on the passage, I will fill in the blanks:

After another barmy day in the Championship we are still no closer to finding out which three clubs will be promoted to the Premier League. Eight sides still have a chance of claiming one of the two automatic promotion places, even with just five games left to play of the regular season. And then there are the play-offs – notoriously hard to call but surely even more so this season given the fine margins that separate this year's promotion-chasing crop. Regardless of who goes up though, there have been some stellar individual performances this season that will no doubt have attracted top flight attention. Here are eight players - one each from Bournemouth, Norwich, Watford, Middlesbrough, Derby, Wolves, Brentford and Ipswich - that could well be playing in the top flight next season regardless of whether their club goes up or not. Troy Deeney scores as Watford beat Middlesbrough on Monday in a crucial clash in the Championship . Matt Ritchie . Club: Bournemouth. Position: Winger. Age: 25. Games: 41. Goals: 11. Though left-footed, Ritchie operates on the right flank and his energy and eye for a goal sum up Eddie Howe's attacking side. A product of Portsmouth's academy, he never got a look-in at Fratton Park and has risen through the lower leagues and now looks destined for the top flight. It was the Scotland international's £400,000 move to Bournemouth from Swindon in January 2013 that triggered Paolo di Canio's dramatic resignation at the County Ground. Bournemouth winger Matt Ritchie celebrates as Bournemouth beat Birmingham on Easter Monday . Bradley Johnson . Club: Norwich. Position: Midfielder. Age: 27. Games: 38. Goals: 13. Norwich did well to hang on to Johnson after being relegated last summer and if they don't make an immediate return he will surely still be back in the Premier League - where he proved a reliable performer for the three seasons prior to this - come August. A powerful, deep-lying midfielder with a solid all-round game, the ex-Leeds man has added goals to his repertoire this season, scoring more in 38 games than he had in his previous four seasons. Experienced midfielder Bradley Johnson has been in prolific form in front of goal this season . Troy Deeney . Club: Watford. Position: Striker. Age: 26. Games: 37. Goals: 20. Deeney has plundered 63 goals in the Championship in the past three seasons and with his 27th birthday approaching in the summer he surely has to be playing in the Premier League next season. A product of Walsall's academy, Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and has impressively rebuilt his career and life since. Deeney has been consistently excellent for Watford over the last three seasons . Patrick Bamford . Club: Middlesbrough. Position: Forward. Age: 21. Games: 34. Goals: 15. Having spent spells on loan from Chelsea at MK Dons, Derby and Boro in League One and now the Championship, the next step in Bamford's progression will be in the Premier League next season. If Boro go up, Jose Mourinho will surely be happy for the England Under 21 international to continue under the tutelage of his former No 2 and Boro boss Aitor Karanka. If not, there will be plenty of other suitors for the tall, versatile forward. Patrick Bamford (centre) moved to the Riverside on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea last summer . Will Hughes . ______ Not 20 until later this month, Hughes will be a name familiar with many of our readers given his exploits for Gareth Southgate's England Under 21 side, for whom he has 14 caps. Making his debut as a 17-year-old, the elegant left-footed midfielder has already played over 130 times for Derby and has no shortage of admirers among the Premier League's elite. Derby midfielder Will Hughes has plenty of experience despite still being a teenager . Bakary Sako . Club: Wolves. Position: Winger. Age: 26. Games: 36. Goals: 13. When Sako moved to Wolves for £4million from St Etienne he would have had hopes of playing in the Premier League before too long. Instead, he found himself  in League One a year later. To his credit though, he stayed and spearheaded Wolves' romp to the League One title last year and has been the key man in their bid to make it back-to-back promotions. His contract is up this summer and a new one will only be signed if Wolves achieve that. Bakary Sako (centre) has become a cult hero at Molineux but looks certain to leave if Wolves don't go up . Alex Pritchard . Club: Brentford. Position: Attacking midfielder. Age: 21. Games: 41. Goals: 9. Another side bidding for back-to-back promotions are Brentford and Tottenham loanee Pritchard has been key in their surprise success story. Short, agile, quick and versatile, Pritchard is in the Spanish mould of midfielder we have been craving for so long in this country. Given Mauricio Pochettino's track record of developing youth it wouldn't be a surprise to see him in Spurs' squad next season though they may opt to loan him out  to a smaller Premier League club. Alex Pritchard takes on Liverpool's Emre Can during an Under 21 international last month . Tyrone Mings . Club: Ipswich. Position: Left back. Age: 22. Games: 35. Goals: 1. Linked with Arsenal and Crystal Palace in January, Mings' form has tailed off of late with Ipswich's but he has all the attributes required to succeed at the highest level. Tall for a full back at 6ft 5in Mings is nonetheless quick and full of attacking intent. He was let go by both Southampton and Bristol Rovers as a teen before arriving at Ipswich in 2012 via non-league. Giant Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings attracted interest from Premier League clubs in January . We’ve also come up with a composite XI made up by the best players from the eight clubs. This side would surely stay up in the Premier League with ease... Composite XI (4-2-3-1): John Ruddy (Norwich); Dominic Iorfa (Wolves), Russell Martin (Norwich), Steve Cook (Bournemouth), Tyrone Mings (Ipswich); Will Hughes (Derby), Bradley Johnson (Norwich); Matt Ritchie (Bournemouth), Alex Pritchard (Brentford), Bakary Sako (Wolves); Troy Deeney (Watford).",Club: Derby.

Ospina has kept six clean sheets in those 12 games with his only defeat coming against Tottenham in the north London derby on February 7 to boast an impressive win percentage. But who else makes the top 10? Ospina has the highest win ratio of any Premier League player to make more than 10 appearances .

The Montenegro international has a win ratio of 90.9 per cent after appearing on the losing side just once during his only season with the Premier League champions. Gerard Pique, who spent four years at Manchester United, makes up the top three after winning 10 of his 12 Premier League games before rejoining Barcelona and going on to win countless trophies, including a World Cup with Spain. Gerard Pique made 12 Premier League appearances for Manchester United, winning 10 of them . Arjen Robben posts an impressive 82.1 per cent win ration in the Premier League from 67 matches . Asier del Horno won 20 times during his only season in the Premier League with Chelsea in 2005-06 . Arjen Robben has arguably the most impressive stats of any player on the list for the number of appearances he made for Chelsea during a three-year spell. The Bayern Munich winger was on the winning side an incredible 55 times from his 67 games giving him a win ration of 82.1 per cent. Another former Chelsea player Asier del Horno is fifth on the list with 80 per cent and is followed by current Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin with 78.6. Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin (left) has won 11 of his 14 league games this season . Manchester United forward James Wilson has won 10 of 13 appearances in the league . Igor Stepanov made 17 appearances for Arsenal in the early 2000s and won 13 matches . Manchester United's 19-year-old striker James Wilson has only failed to be on the winning side three times from his 13 appearances putting him seventh on the list, while former Arsenal defender Igor Stepanovs' 76.5 per cent is enough to put him eighth. Nacho Monreal, currently preferred to Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal left back, has won 43 games from his 57 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side. United defender Paddy McNair sneaks into the top 10 with 75 per cent having featured 12 times under Louis van Gaal this season, winning nine. When did Ospina join Arsenal? Arsenal signed Ospina from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The 26-year-old made close to 200 appearances for the French club during six seasons. How much did Arsenal pay for him? Originally signed as back-up and competition for Wojciech Szczesny after the Gunners No 2 Lukasz Fabianski joined Swansea, Ospina cost a paltry £3million. Is he of international calibre? Ospina had won 52 caps for Colombia and impressed during their run to the World Cup quarter-final in Brazil last summer. When did Ospina make his first appearance for Arsenal? ______ It later emerged that the Poland goalkeeper was caught smoking in the showers after the game. Ospina kept his place for the league game the following week and has played every Premier League match since. Did you know...

Despite already re-shaping Manchester United's fortunes and guiding them to third in the Barclays Premier League, ahead of the derby with City, Van Gaal is pressing ahead with plans for more big name signings this summer. ______ Mats Hummels (left) looks likely to join Manchester United this summer to strengthen their porous rearguard . Hummels and Gundogan are likely to be lining up in red for United next year if Van Gaal gets his way . United are believed to have responded to the signal from the Germany midfielder and are confident of agreeing a fee with Dortmund. Both players have been on United's radar for some time, and both have privately let it be known they feel the time has arrived for a fresh start. Dortmund bosses are resigned to Gundogan following Hummels out of the door after the midfield anchorman flatly refused to renew a £100,000-a-week contract that runs out next year and evidently made little secret of his wish to join United. At the age of 26, Hummels (right) has made 39 appearances for Germany and won the World Cup last year . Van Gaal is set to be handed a £150m transfer kitty to further strengthen United in his second year at the club . A powerful figure at the base of Dortmund's midfield, Gundogan might normally have cost a sizeable chunk of Van Gaal's £150m summer budget but could be prised away for as little as £15m, given the time left on his contract. Dortmund will ask for around £36m for Hummels.","Sportsmail revealed last week that Germany centre Mats Hummels has indicated he's finally ready to become a United player, and it now seems it will be as part of a £50m-plus Borussia Dortmund double after Gundogan also gave Van Gaal the go-ahead to bid for his services. Ilkay Gundogan (right) anchors Dortmund's midfield and could be brought in to protect United's defence .","Manchester United are believed to have responded to the signal from Dortmund with a general offer of £45m, although the two parties are likely to be willing to negotiate and the final agreed price is hoped to be £40m",0.8623384237,0.8283811808,0.8450188041,0.2075471698,0.0,0.1320754717,0.1320754717
