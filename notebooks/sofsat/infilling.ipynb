       "'\\n\\nDoes One Gallon Equal 128 Ounces?\\n\\nOne gallon is equal to 128 ounces when measuring liquid volume. However, when measuring weight, one gallon of water weighs approximately 8.34 pounds, so 128 ounces would be roughly 8.6 pounds, which is not exactly one gallon in weight.\\n\\nThe conversion from gallons to ounces is a straightforward one:\\n\\n1 gallon = 128 ounces\\n\\nTo better understand this relationship, one quart is equivalent to 32 ounces. There are four quarts in one gallon, so 1 gallon = 4 quarts = 128 ounces.\\n\\nFAQs:\\n\\n1. How many pints are in a gallon?\\nOne gallon is equal to 160 pints.\\n2. How many liters are in a gallon?\\nOne gallon is equal to approximately 3.785 liters.\\n3. How many cups are in a gallon?\\nOne gallon is equal to 128 cups (assuming each cup holds 8 ounces).\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nWhen measuring liquid volumes, one gallon is indeed equal to 128 ounces. Using this conversion can help make accurate measurements for various recipes or serving sizes. Furthermore, other volume conversion factors, such as pints to quarts, quarts to gallons, and liters to gallons, can offer conversions for those encountering these measurements in their daily lives.'"

In September 2013, he tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashanah\" in response to which Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, tweeted \"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran\\'s Holocaust denial, sir.\" Zarif responded, \"Iran never denied it. The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" This exchange referenced Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month, and Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by his successor. However, during the Iranian Revolution in the late 1970s, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco to expel people who were not considered Islamic enough. He later made a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations, leading to him being offered a job by the Iranian ambassador. Despite this, Zarif and Kerry have spent more time together than any other foreign ministers in the world and will continue to work closely as they try to meet the June 30 deadline for finalizing the details of their nuclear agreement.', ' The five individuals who were being monitored at an Omaha, Nebraska hospital for being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have all been released.

It is expected to make landfall Sunday morning on the southeastern coast of Isabela province and exit the Philippines by Monday.

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately predict the missing sentence based on the provided context alone. However, based on the overall theme of the article, which is discussing famous performances of the national anthem and their reception, the missing sentence could potentially be a criticism of Neil's performance. For example:\\n\\n<SENTENCE_MASK> Critics were merciless in their assessment of Neil's rendition of the national anthem, with some calling it a brutal butchering of the tune and others likening it to a train wreck.\\n\\n<SENTENCE_MASK> While some applauded Neil for bringing his unique style to the national anthem, others felt that he had disrespected the flag and the country with his sloppy performance.\\n\\n<SENTENCE_MASK> Neil's version of the national anthem left many in attendance wishing they had stayed home, with one spectator declaring that it was the worst rendition they had ever heard.\\n\\nOf these options, the first and third sentences are more likely to be true based on the context provided in the article, which mentions criticism of Neil's performance. However, without further information, it is impossible to know for sure what was actually said by critics.\", ' The opposition from Walmart, a company that employs more than 50,000 people in Arkansas, put significant pressure on the governor to veto the bill, citing the importance of upholding workplace policies that promote gay equality and protect against discrimination. This stance once again positions Walmart at odds with many in the Republican Party. However, some prominent Republicans, like Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, are urging the party to take notice of these shifts in public opinion and support policies that help the middle class and prohibit discrimination in areas such as jobs, housing, and public accommodations against gays and lesbians.', ' The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the United Nations was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include China, where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan Africa -- Equatorial Guinea, Somalia and Sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The Americas continued to be execution-free, apart from the United States. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.', ' \"That is something we did not know before. The correspondence between Lubitz and the flight school regarding his depression during his training was not previously disclosed.\"', ' The explosive growth of his tiny congregation, which Schuller referred to as a miracle, quickly outgrew the drive-in theater. He sold a softer, gentler message, borrowing heavily from Norman Vincent Peale\\'s feel-good gospel, preaching not to convert or condemn people but to encourage them with his phrase, \"possibility thinking.\" To many, it was evangelicalism at its best, the innovative and uptick-focused movement that reached people. But to others, it was weak tea, a corporation marketing strategy masquerading as theology. Regardless, Schuller\\'s impact cannot be ignored: in 1970, he began broadcasting \"Hour of Power,\" believed to be the first, if not the very first, Sunday service to be shown regularly on television, reaching millions and making Schuller a pioneering televangelist. His architectural masterpiece, the Crystal Cathedral, with its 10,000 glass panels, still stands in Orange County, California. However, during the 1980s and 1990s, Schuller and his family faced a devastating succession scandal and financial turmoil. \"Hour of Power\" and Crystal Cathedral, once soaring powerhouses, crumbled into bankruptcy. In the end, Schuller\\'s grandson, Bobby, took over the television ministry, standing atop Crystal Cathedral\\'s Tower of Hope, with a vast landscape before them - a testament to their family legacy.', \" Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran, the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb. One deadline passed Tuesday, but there is a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal -- with all technical and diplomatic impasses fully worked out. Bachmann's comparison of Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight was widely criticized on social media, with many calling her comments moronic, despicable, and inappropriate. Despite the criticism, Bachmann has been a vocal critic of Obama's Iran policy and has previously called for military action against Iran's nuclear facilities. At the 2014 White House Christmas Party, she told the President that he needed to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The President reportedly responded with a condescending smile and laughed at her suggestion.\", ' They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing.', \" The misunderstanding that the negotiations aimed for the complete elimination of Iran's nuclear program from the outset also spreads to the belief that this framework agreement contains a sunset clause. However, the articles stipulates that this is not the case. The restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities that will be eased or eliminated over time will only apply to uranium enrichment and not all areas of Iran's nuclear program. The permanent provision in the agreement is Iran's ratification of the Additional Protocol, which grants IAEA inspectors expanded access to nuclear facilities, both declared and undeclared. This provision remains in effect indefinitely to ensure ongoing monitoring of Iran's nuclear activities.\", ' The ongoing California drought not only affects California but also the rest of the country. It has led to higher prices for various groceries due to decreased agricultural production in the state. In 2014, fresh fruit and vegetable prices rose significantly due to the drought. For instance, the price of berries increased by about 80 cents per clamshell, broccoli by 11 cents per pound, grapes by 64 cents a pound, melons by 24 cents a pound, packaged salad by 23 cents a bag, and peppers by 26 cents a pound. The USDA projects that fresh fruit prices are expected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3% this year. However, the strong dollar and lower oil prices may help mitigate the impact on food prices by allowing for the importation of crops from other countries and easier transportation of food across the country. The extent to which the California drought will affect food prices this year is unknown, as farmers have yet to make decisions regarding crop planting. Additionally, the ongoing drought is not limited to California, with Texas and Oklahoma also experiencing extreme and exceptional drought in several parts of their states, affecting millions of people. The drought has led to higher beef and veal prices in the past, and could potentially do so again this year. Other areas in the Western and Southwestern United States are also being affected by drought, with potential consequences for food prices.', \" The FBI arrested Keonna Thomas, a Philadelphia woman, on March 26, 2016, and charged her with attempting to provide material support and resources to ISIS after discovering numerous social media messages in which she expressed a desire to join the terrorist organization and travel to Syria. Thomas had purchased an electronic visa to Turkey on March 23, and she was planning to travel to Barcelona on March 29 with a return date of April 15, indicating she intended to enter Syria from Turkey. It is currently unknown when or where she was arrested. Additionally, on March 26, Noelle Velentzas, 28, and her former roommate, Asia Siddiqui, 31, were arrested in New York for planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States. Over the past 18 months, the Department of Justice's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of individuals attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups, with 18 of those cases involving support to ISIS. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson stated that the terrorist threat is increasingly decentralized and complicated, involving lone wolf actors and the effective use of social media and the Internet.\", ' During the match against Iraq, activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of Ghoncheh Ghavami, a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match.', \" The Internet has become the go-to platform for individuals in authoritarian countries to express dissenting views due to the ease and low cost of posting online and the lack of access to traditional media. In Singapore, for example, the government primarily uses the courts to silence critics through libel and defamation cases, often resulting in heavy financial penalties. This was demonstrated in the cases of Amos Yee and Roy Ngerng, among others. Similar situations have occurred in other countries, such as Malaysia and Vietnam, where Internet activity is heavily monitored and restricted. The Committee to Protect Journalists has documented numerous instances of individuals facing legal and financial repercussions for their online activities. It's important to note that this trend is not unique to Asia, but it may be more pronounced in the region.\", ' \"I really just want to enjoy life from here on out,\" she said.

As the moon moves deeper into the Earth\\'s shadow, it appears to turn dark and may take on a reddish hue due to the filtering of most blue light through Earth\\'s atmosphere, giving it the nickname of the \"blood moon.\" Lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but the one on Saturday is part of a series of four consecutive lunar eclipses, known as a \"tetrad,\" which began on April 15, 2014, was followed by another in September 2014, and will continue with this one and another on September 28. NASA astronomer Mitzi Adams will be answering questions about the eclipse on Twitter @NASA_Marshall. If you have seen the total lunar eclipse, please share your photos with CNN iReport.', ' As Ethiopia\\'s invasion and occupation of parts of Somalia -- although invited by the Somali government and backed by the African Union -- enabled Al-Shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an Islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign \"Christian\" invasion, it initially primarily attacked Ethiopian forces but soon began to expand its activities against the Somali government as well. The first attack outside Somalia was an attack in the Ugandan capital of Kampala in 2010. Soon after this, cross-border raids in Kenya began, predominantly targeting Christians there.', \" The astronomical occurrences used to determine the date of Easter include the spring equinox and the full moon. The first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox is used as the basis for celebrating Easter, although the exact date varies from year to year due to the discrepancy between the lunar cycle and Earth's orbit. Orthodox Christians sometimes have separate Easter celebrations due to their reluctance to adopt the Gregorian calendar. The origins of Easter traditions like the bunny and colored eggs are not definitively known but are believed to have origins in Germany and pre-Christian pagan customs. For those coloring Easter eggs, Kool-Aid provides an alternative to the traditional vinegar method and produces bright colors. However, be aware that it can stain other materials.\", \" The NCAA's response to the lawsuit filed by UNC athletes claims that it has no legal responsibility to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions. This position contrasts with the NCAA's stated commitment to giving young people opportunities to learn and succeed academically while balancing athletic endeavors. The organization likened its role to that of professional organizations like the American Bar Association or American Medical Association and argued that they are not held liable every time a professional acts inappropriately. This inconsistency in the NCAA's stance on academic responsibilities has left critics questioning the organization's focus on education for its student-athletes.\", \" She ran away from the hospital after two days of chemotherapy, stating that she didn't want to undergo the treatment.\", ' \"Style\" reaches No. 1 on the Adult Pop Songs airplay chart.', ' The unprecedented temperature reading at Esperanza Base adds to the growing body of evidence suggesting that climate change is causing significant warming in Antarctica.', ' The Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from \"substantially burdening\" a person\\'s exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too.Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are \"exceedingly rare,\" and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. <SENTENCE_MASK> However, there have been notable cases that touch upon an array of religious matters from eagle feathers used in Native American ceremonies to a sacramental tea used by a Brazilian faith and a small ceremonial sword carried by a Sikh woman. In each case, the individuals or organizations invoked their religious freedoms to challenge government actions that they believed infringed upon their beliefs. While not all of these cases resulted in victories, they highlight the ongoing debates and complexities surrounding the interpretation and application of religious freedom laws.', ' \"My heart goes out to his family and God bless him and them in this sad time.

However, Rolling Stone\\'s lawyers might counter that the group is too large and fluid to have individually identifiable injuries, making it difficult for the members to bring a successful lawsuit. Additionally, plaintiffs must demonstrate financial harm to pursue a defamation case, which may be a challenge for some individuals. Nevertheless, if members of Phi Kappa Psi or any other implicated fraternities can clear the initial hurdles of a defamation claim and prove damages, they might have a chance at a successful lawsuit.', ' \"What is important for the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in Shibuya is the ruling will make us visible in society,\" Matsunaka said.', ' Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital.

That\\'s why, for Cruz, courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base. His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction. He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS, and, in a knock against the National Security Agency, he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama \"can hear every word I have to say.\" Cruz argued Thursday that the Republican Party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the Ron Paul-Rand Paul faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the Santorum base -- evangelicals. \"If we\\'re going to win, we\\'ve got to bring that coalition together,\" he said in Cedar Falls. \"And I think we can do that.\" Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election, a higher than normal turnout for the demographic. That number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it\\'s not too far off from the 56% of the overall population that voted in 2012. Still, his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who\\'ve been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform, then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls. \"If you look at available places for the party to expand the vote, it doesn\\'t exist in the middle, it exists in the evangelical vote,\" said Rick Tyler, a top Cruz adviser. \"It isn\\'t a pond, it\\'s an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative.\" Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, expected to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says.

When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system.

The agents were caught when one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee. As a result, the Americans looked dumb, incompetent—and cheap. And in 2009, the President, new on the job, was caught flat-footed by a fast-talking, fiery anti-American president of Venezuela.

According to a report from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 7.7 million low-income households live in substandard housing, spend more than half their incomes on rent, or both. These families are dedicating $1 out of every $2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head. This situation not only hurts individual families but also harms the economy by reducing investments in education, savings, and local businesses. To address this issue, HUD is focusing on both preserving existing affordable housing and creating new affordable units. By preserving the 700,000 affordable units that are in danger of losing their affordability due to mortgage maturities, HUD is working with private partners to keep these homes affordable for future generations. The Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) initiative is bringing private investment to the public sector for the preservation of public housing, resulting in significant repairs and improvements for residents. In addition to preservation, HUD is also creating new affordable housing through programs like the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which leverages private resources for every dollar invested and leads to over one million new and rehabilitated units for lower income families. To continue this progress, HUD is seeking increased funding for these programs from Congress and expanding the Housing Choice Voucher Program.

It ended on Monday, when Scott Kelley and Mary Nunes entered the U.S. Consulate in Costa Rica and requested passports so they could return to the United States.

In response to Saudi Arabia\\'s intervention in Yemen, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized the Saudi regime in a speech, and religious pilgrimages to Mecca were suspended due to reports of Iranian teenagers being sexually assaulted by Saudi police. Anti-Saudi protests have also taken place in various cities across Iran, with hardline figures like General Ahmad Purdastan threatening Riyadh with ominous warnings. Even Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a vocal advocate for improved Iranian-Saudi relations, labeled the Saudi military intervention in Yemen a \"strategic mistake.\" However, despite Iran\\'s advocacy for a political solution to the Yemeni crisis, the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim, given the Saudi rejection of Iranian proposals and the lack of international backing for a military victory. This leaves both sides with challenging decisions to make. Saudi Arabia must decide how far it is willing to push its military intervention, while Iran must consider the potential risks of further fuelling sectarian tensions in the Middle East.

First, it\\'s important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court\\'s intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event. Yes, parents who can\\'t resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts, but once the courts and law enforcement are involved, they do things their way. And it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own. South Carolina family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings. Oftentimes and sadly so, papa is a rolling stone, and he falls behind on his payments. When a supporting parent has fallen behind, the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order. At the hearing, that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that, well, he would love to pay, but right now he\\'s just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well-established language of support shirkers. The bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he\\'s too poor to pay his child\\'s support. If he fails to demonstrate this inability, the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him, unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments. What follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon, a game show and debtor\\'s prison. The defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail. If he can\\'t, he\\'ll be stuck in jail until he does pay. And let\\'s face it: While it\\'s hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads, jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to, you guessed it, earn money to pay that debt. Of course, since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant, dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates \"mixed up.\" The court\\'s remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court.

She can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly all over the country, in red and blue states, when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates. For instance, in the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats who heavily pandered to women on reproductive issues at the expense of addressing real issues and men suffered significant losses. Examples include Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado, who was nicknamed \"Mark Uterus,\" Democratic candidate Martha Robertson in New York, who drew laughs for accusing her opponent of waging a \"war on women,\" and Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, who attempted to blame sexism for the Democrats\\' lack of popularity in the South. Even in Texas, where liberal Wendy Davis ran primarily on an abortion rights platform, she accused Republicans of sexism for scrutinizing her inaccurate biography. However, her opponent, Greg Abbott, won by a substantial margin and Davis only received 47% of the women\\'s vote. In both red and blue states, voters demonstrated that they care about more than just reproductive issues and were not swayed by false accusations of sexism. With these lessons from the recent past, Clinton may want to consider courting men rather than solely focusing on a woman-centered campaign in order to broaden her support base.', \" The dress -- a jacket and full skirt ensemble -- was worn in several key scenes in the 1939 movie, including when Scarlett O'Hara encounters Butler and when she gets attacked in the shanty town.\", ' The spill\\'s effects on other species are less clear. For example, dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the Gulf Coast, and even more so in Louisiana where the oil hit the hardest. But the dolphin \"mortality event,\" as the government calls it, began months before the spill. Studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like Barataria Bay, Louisiana, could be caused by oil exposure, but direct links to the 2010 Macondo spill have not been proven. Seaside sparrows in the Gulf are also showing signs of strain, and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance. While aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters, government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long-term effects on sea turtle populations. But perhaps the greatest unknown is what, if anything, millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the Gulf itself. Oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the Macondo well as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean. Mandy Joye, an oceanographer with the University of Georgia, has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled. Her research and other studies show BP\\'s oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor. According to Joye\\'s study the oil residue exists in thin layers in some areas of the seafloor and thick pockets in others. Joye is trying to determine how the oil deposited on the seafloor -- estimated to be about 10 million gallons -- affects the microbial community of organisms that exists in the deepwater ocean. \"That stuff\\'s not going to stay put,\" Joye said. \"It\\'s going to move around. \" she added. \"There\\'s so much that we don\\'t know,\" Joye said.

Charles Lee, a Korean-Canadian who works in Seoul, shares that drinking is seen as a way to truly get to know someone, as conversation is often limited at work or during meals. He also explains that there are certain rules to follow during hoesik to avoid offending others, such as identifying the higher person in the relationship, always keeping a full glass, holding bottles or shot glasses with both hands, and being open to singing at the karaoke bar.

Being aware of the social context and nuances of hoesik can make all the difference in creating a positive impression and avoiding misunderstandings.\\n\\nFor instance, age and hierarchical relationships are significant factors in Korean drinking culture. Seniors are always given priority, and it is essential to defer to them accordingly. One of the ways to show respect is by asking about someone's age and using certain language depending on their age or position.\\n\\nMoreover, having an empty glass is considered impolite. When seniors are pouring alcohol, others should wait until they have been served before taking a drink. Turning your body away from senior figures while drinking is another custom that shows respect. Always holding bottles or shot glasses with both hands is a sign of humility and submission, and not raising your glass or pouring alcohol with just one hand may be perceived as a sign of seniority.\\n\\nIt is also essential to be aware of people's drinking habits before attending a hoesik event. The article suggests that asking someone what they like to drink or how they behave when intoxicated will help you prepare for each round. Moreover, hoesik usually involves changing venues for different types of alcohol.

Lynch has several tools at her disposal to guide local law enforcement towards better behavior, such as the Community Oriented Policing Services program and the power to sue departments and secure court-ordered reforms.

However, the country's enormous wealth, much of which comes from oil, has long eluded the poor, with corruption deeply entrenched in the system. The wealthy buy off the anger of the poorest through patronage and shady deals, and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime. When oil prices collapsed, the government lacked the funds to promise jobs to voters and had to turn to creative economic development strategies such as the massive privatization of the power system. However, these attempts at reform were not enough to address the problem of corruption or the rise of terrorism, particularly from Boko Haram. The government's handling of the terrorism crisis, which was focused mostly in Muslim population centers, was hindered by dysfunctionality and ineffective security measures. The victory of a Muslim candidate in Nigeria does not represent the victory of Islamism, but rather a longing for a time when the army was relatively well-paid and respected. Buhari, who ran the country along dictatorial lines in the early 1980s and launched a War Against Indiscipline campaign with drastic measures against civil servants and politicians, has promised to tackle the intertwined problems of Boko Haram and corruption.

However, last weekend, as Baltimore dealt with ongoing public safety issues due to the unrest following the death of Freddie Gray, Major League Baseball faced a problem with the Orioles\\' home stand. Fans were asked to remain in their seats after games due to safety concerns, resulting in the postponement of multiple games. This was not the first time MLB had to address political unrest in relation to baseball; past incidents include postponements during the 1967 Detroit riots, the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s assassination, and the Rodney King verdict. Despite these challenges, the deep investment in our sports teams is meant to foster a sense of community and belonging. However, as Daniel Nathan, editor of \"Rooting for the Home Team: Sport, Community and Identity,\" noted, baseball or sports in general cannot heal the wounds from such social and cultural ruptures. In an unprecedented move, the public was barred from attending the final game of the series between the Orioles and Chicago White Sox, moving the game to the afternoon in accordance with Baltimore\\'s mayoral curfew. The absence of fans leads one to question: Does baseball hold meaning without an audience? When architects hailed the return of the old-time stadium in Baltimore\\'s Camden Yards, fans remembered fondly the good old days. But with less than 10% of baseball players and fans being African American, it is important to acknowledge their differing memories of history. Chris Rock highlighted this in a recent \"Real Sports\" episode, criticizing the sense of nostalgia associated with baseball and the lack of black representation in the sport. Orioles Executive Vice President John Angelos acknowledged the importance of focusing on the root causes of social and political unrest rather than just the inconvenience of postponed games. As America grapples with issues such as race relations, poverty, and police brutality, the continued prioritization of keeping baseball players and games safe underscores the complex nature of how our society values sports.

Second, and just as importantly, Pyongyang's advances in mobile ICBM capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the Korean Peninsula.

The larger issue at hand is the disproportionate representation of race within law enforcement agencies and the potential for racial bias to play a role in policing.

The operation to stop and return the boats, called \"Operation Sovereign Borders,\" has been politically tumultuous for Australia\\'s relationship with Indonesia. Returning boats to international waters potentially violates Australia\\'s obligation to international maritime law; push-backs to Indonesian waters violates Indonesia\\'s sovereignty and has placed people at great risk. In 2013 and 2014, the Australian government sought the Sri Lankan government\\'s assistance to intercept those attempting to flee, and receive those who had already fled the country, at a time when that government was under investigation by the UN Human Rights Council for war crimes and crimes against humanity. As the situation in Europe illustrates, just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum. In the short term, the \"stop the boats\" approach appears to be working for the Australian government. It is questionable whether this policy is financially or politically sustainable in the long term. It certainly has not ended people smuggling or people\\'s attempts to seek asylum in the wider Asia-Pacific region. Nando Sigona argues that the recent tragedy in Italy is not just about how to manage search and rescue operations, but requires consistent and long-term engagement with the root causes of refugee flows. This is a message that both the European Union and Australia should heed. Italy is a good example of the failure of trying to stop asylum seekers with deterrence. The Italian government ended its Mare Nostrum search and rescue program last autumn, which was effective but was also costing the Italian government €9.5 million per month. It was replaced by a much smaller European Union-run program, Operation Triton, which has a smaller patrol area and a budget of less than a third that of Mare Nostrum. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra\\'ad Al Hussein, has noted that this new program is totally inadequate and \\'more geared to border control and policing the seas than to saving lives\\'.

Patients have described these garments as \"horrible,\" \"demeaning,\" \"belittling,\" and \"disempowering.\" However, some hospitals have started to address this issue by working with fashion designers to create new, more patient-friendly designs. For instance, the Cleveland Clinic collaborated with fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg to introduce a new gown with a V-neck front and back, complete derriere coverage, pockets, softer fabric, and bolder print patterns. Patients reported feeling much more comfortable in the new design, both physically and emotionally. In recent years, more hospitals have been focusing on enhancing the patient experience as part of a broader trend to improve patient reviews and hospital bottom lines.

Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein\\'s Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein\\'s New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. \"Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,\" he stated, \"that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.\"', ' It is still unclear when a comprehensive deal, including the resolution of all technical details and diplomatic impasses, will be reached, if at all.', ' The idea of implementing enhanced crash avoidance software that can take over aircraft control to steer the plane to a safe altitude in case of an incapacitated pilot or ignored warnings is not new.

During this time, the moon took on a distinct reddish hue, earning the eclipses the nickname \"blood moon.\" Eastern portions of North America were able to catch a partial view of the eclipse before the moon set below the horizon. Observers from the U.S. West Coast to Australia were treated to the full total eclipse, while parts of South America, India, China, and Russia also had a partial view. Lunar eclipses occur when the sun, Earth, and moon align in space, with the Earth casting a shadow that causes the moon to appear dark. The reddish color is due to Earth\\'s atmosphere filtering out most of the blue light. According to NASA, lunar eclipses usually occur at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a \"tetrad.\" The first two occurred on April 15, 2014, and October 23, 2014, with the next one predicted for September 28.

This unique approach to education integrates online instruction with a more conventional classroom setup. Approximately one-third of the school\\'s 2,700 students currently participate in this program, with plans to enroll the majority by 2015. As a top-ranked junior who juggles a demanding load of extracurricular activities alongside his academics, Zobott appreciates the flexibility and autonomy offered by blended learning. \"I can learn at my own pace, the way I want to learn,\" he expressed. In this blended environment, the curriculum is developed by teachers, who welcome student feedback. While students have the option for a flexible schedule during scheduled blended learning days, they may also meet with teachers in person. Huntley High School\\'s educational technology leader, Anne Pasco, explained, \"In blended learning, we focus on the content, not on covering X amount of material.\" This allows students to expand their learning experiences while benefiting from a supportive environment. The program\\'s success originated from a need to provide struggling students with more one-on-one teacher interaction during the school day. Prior to blended learning, such assistance was often limited to after-school hours or occasionally unavailable. Now, students can receive individual attention during class hours. Teachers are able to monitor student progress and lesson plans online to evaluate the amount of time invested on particular assignments. Flexibility is a crucial component, as the class schedule can be adjusted based on students\\' needs. John Burkey, the superintendent for Huntley High\\'s school district, emphasized the program\\'s benefits. \"Blended learning is not a panacea, and the success of the program isn\\'t about spending a bunch of money on technology. Rather, it\\'s about adapting to students\\' needs and building a culture of innovation.\" For Burkey, concerns about affordability arose when the Chicago district introduced blended learning in 2011. It was discovered that the program costs approximately $8,500 per student, which is less than the Illinois average of $12,000 per student. \"We didn\\'t put new money into this,\" Burkey noted. \"Instead, we changed the', ' In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\"', ' He asked for peace from drug dealers, corrupt officials who collaborate with them, and arms dealers.', ' The incident at Duke University is not an isolated one, as there have been similar racist events at other colleges recently.

Labour and Conservatives combined took 97% of the votes, making the recent TV debate between David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Nigel Farage, Natalie Bennett, Nicola Sturgeon, and Leanne Wood of the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UK Independence Party, Green Party, Scottish National Party, and Plaid Cymru parties, respectively, a complex and uncertain affair. Yet, from this highly confusing encounter, some lessons can be drawn.\\n\\n<SENTENCE_MASK>\\n\\nThe debates have confirmed the general perception that Britain's voters don't much like the Conservatives despite the recovering economy but don't quite trust Labour to continue the improvement. Miliband, told by his handlers to look tough, is using the 'i' word too much. Cameron, on the other hand, is curiously short on passion.\\n\\nAnother oddity of the Seven Up debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved, Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party and Wood of Plaid Cymru. However, Sturgeon's high score in the post-debate polls was significant. She was sharp and sassy, and the number of seats gained by the Nationalists, currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 Westminster Parliament seats in Scotland, will be crucial.\\n\\nIf there was a 'winner' in the debate, it was undoubtedly Nicola Sturgeon. Back in the 2010 UK election debates, the clear victor was Clegg of the Liberal Democrats. However, by entering a coalition government with Cameron, Clegg surrendered the Lib Dems' previous ability to pick up protest votes. The party has paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government, particularly on student tuition fees. His debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders, but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10%. Perception is everything. In social media and studio focus groups, there were plenty of plaudits for the Greens and even for Plaid Cymru's Wood, but Clegg got hardly a mention.\\n\\nUKIP remains the joker in the pack.

The terrorist group, which is based in Somalia but has made deadly incursions into neighboring Kenya, separates people by religion during their attacks and allows Muslims to leave. Hundreds of students managed to escape the Garissa University College attack, some by running, others by crawling, and all with a deep fear for their lives. The terror continued for around 15 hours before four attackers were killed, and the operation was declared \"successful.\" However, 147 people had been killed and plans were being made to evacuate affected persons. The terrorists had targeted a Christian prayer meeting, shooting indiscriminately, sparing only their Muslim fellow attackers. It is a devastating day for Kenya. Such terrorism is not new to the people of eastern Kenya, but the targeting of an institute of higher learning is reminiscent of attacks by other Islamist extremist groups like the Pakistani Taliban and Boko Haram. Garissa University College began as a teacher training college in the 1990s and became a degree-granting institution in 2011, with schools of education, information science, and arts and social sciences and a growing staff.

However, UEFA's decision to replay the match sets a dangerous precedent and raises questions about the potential for more appeals of this nature in the future. England's appeal, which cost just £750, was successful but raises concerns about the cost and feasibility of similar appeals in higher level male competitions, where it may not be guaranteed that an error can be corrected. Additionally, it prompts questions about the standard of refereeing in lower level matches and whether such mistakes are more common due to the smaller crowds and fewer resources. For instance, one can recall a World Cup qualifier between Uzbekistan and Bahrain in September 2005, where a similar incident occurred. Uzbekistan were left incensed when a penalty was disallowed due to an attacking player encroaching, and an indirect free-kick was wrongly awarded to Bahrain instead. Despite calling for an investigation, FIFA ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety, which had a significant impact on the final outcome as Bahrain went through with a 1-1 away goals victory.

'That doesn't sit right with me,' said Hughes afterwards, revealing his preference for the underdog role and creating a siege mentality within his team. However, the dogged and energetic Inverness side, led by their man of the match captain Graeme Shinnie, will undoubtedly perform better as underdogs. With their first major trophy now a mere 21 years since their acrimonious amalgamation and entry into the senior ranks, weeks of uproar and controversy are sure to follow, particularly surrounding the standard of Scottish refereeing, which remains an ongoing embarrassment. Virginil Van Dijk had given Celtic an early lead with a brilliant free-kick, but Inverness denied them a clear penalty and scored an equalizer before half-time. The deciding moment came in the 53rd minute, with Celtic keeper Craig Gordon's red card for upending Marley Watkins while trying to stop him from racing through behind the defense. Regardless, Inverness's determination to play to their strengths paid off, leaving Celtic looking tired and vulnerable in the second half. The absence of Celtic's replacement goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska, who had to replace the injured Fraser Forster, as well as the loss of attacking midfielder Stefan Johansen due to injury, further weakened the champions' attack, leaving them with limited options on the bench.

Sadly, Patton's hopes were ultimately shot down by a double bogey on the 13th attempting to fly Rae's Creek and reach the green in two.

But nothing quite sums up the genius of the late, great Spaniard than the way he clinched his four-shot victory over Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw.

Ultimately, it's up to each individual to determine what approach works best for them on the pitch.\\n\\nManchester City, with their rich history of talented players, have always faced stiff competition from Manchester United. Their victory over United in the 2011 FA Cup semi-finals marked a pivotal moment in the battle for supremacy in the city. Since then, City have maintained their form, winning six of the eight derbies that followed. But, as they face United again at Old Trafford, there's a palpable sense of vulnerability surrounding the blue half of Manchester. United, on a five-match winning streak, are favored to end City's title aspirations. And if they do, the potentially devastating consequences could extend beyond just this season. United, with their deep pockets and ambitious plans, might be able to lure the players City need to maintain their position at the top. To send a clear message to their rivals and ensure their continued success, City's star players—Sergio Aguero, David Silva, Vincent Kompany, and Yaya Toure—will need to exhibit the form and determination that has made them the best in the league.\", \" That is exactly what Chelsea did 12 months ago. After finishing behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Mourinho didn’t hesitate. In came Diego Costa, who had spearheaded Atletico Madrid’s La Liga success, and a World Cup winner in Cesc Fabregas.

We might be doing the same with Arsenal come August if Wenger, who has faced criticism for his spending at Arsenal, is similarly ambitious. Arsenal, it should be noted, are not in dire need of major surgery and the core of their team is now much stronger than it was last season when they barely held off Everton's challenge to finish fourth.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho leads his team out at Stamford Bridge .\\n\\nOne significant area of need is in goal, as David Ospina has shown improvements since taking over for Wojciech Szczesny but Wenger could benefit from the addition of a proven number one keeper like Petr Cech. Another top center back is necessary to strengthen what has been an inconsistent defense, with Gabriel Paulista's arrival being seen more as cover for Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker rather than a long-term solution. Francis Coquelin has been a solid addition to the midfield, but Arsenal may need another strong presence in that area if they aim to challenge next season, especially with Mikel Arteta serving as backup. Paul Pogba is an attractive target, but Wenger did spend £42m on Mesut Ozil, so perhaps they should consider other options as well. At least one world-class defender like Diego Godin would be an ideal addition to the Arsenal backline. Arsenal fans cheer for their team during a home game at the Emirates Stadium . Chelsea fans react after their team's victory over Manchester United .\\n\\nArsenal's good form this season has many thinking that they are on the cusp of title contention once again.

This is a significant increase from the previous voluntary 20 percent cutback in 2014, which was not fully met. The new order aims to reduce water use by 25 percent compared to levels in 2013, with local governments required to charge extra for high water use, tear out 50 million square feet of lawns, and implement rebate programs for water-efficient appliances. The order also proposes bans on watering decorative grasses on public street medians and prohibitions on using drinkable water for irrigation in new homes and developments without water-efficient drip systems.

Erdely requested Jackie's consent once the story started facing public scrutiny. However, it emerged she did not even know how to spell the surname of the man, referred to as 'Drew' in the story. The experts at Columbia concluded that Erdely, her editors, and the fact-checking department all failed to sufficiently attempt contacting the accused and other people mentioned in the story. One possible way Erdley could have discovered inconsistencies in the story was by providing more details to the fraternity and UVA when requesting comment. Phi Kappa Psi's chapter president, Stephehn Scipione, was asked to comment without being given the date of the supposed attack or any details about who was involved. He said, 'It was complete bull***t. They weren't telling me what they were going to write about. They weren't telling me any dates or details.' When the full story was published, Phi Kappa Psi responded by pointing out that there had been no party on the date Jackie provided and that, despite claims of a pledging ritual taking place at the time, the fraternity house was then home to no pledges. The review concluded that Rolling Stone's retraction of the main narrative in 'A Rape on Campus' was a story of journalistic failure that was avoidable.

The article overlooked the gaps in the magazine's reporting by using pseudonyms and failing to state where important information came from.

On Monday, it was reported that a plumber who worked on the building has accused the building's landlord's son, Michael Hrynenko Jr., of making him illegally tap a gas line ahead of the deadly blast on March 26. The unidentified plumber admitted that he illegally tapped a gas line before the explosion but said he only did so on the orders of the landlord's son. The gas was apparently being siphoned from the restaurant to tenants in the building. Investigators suspect the illegal hookup was switched before Con Ed inspectors visited the building on March 26, and after they left, it was put back. Authorities have not yet decided whether to use the plumber's statement against him or if they will get him to testify in exchange for a deal.

The investigation continues as authorities continue to pick through the rubble at the site. But charges including second-degree manslaughter and reckless endangerment could be brought against anyone believed to have been behind the blast. In August, utility workers found that the gas line had been illegally tapped, Con Ed said. The discovery led the company to shut down gas service to the building for about 10 days while the building owner made repairs. Gas service was restored after the utility deemed it safe. Inspectors from Con Ed visited that building about an hour before the explosion and determined work to upgrade gas service didn't pass inspection, locking the line to ensure it wouldn't be used. The work underway was to put in a bigger line to serve the entire building, according to Con Ed. But 15 minutes after the workers left, the smell of gas was reported. No one called 911 or Con Ed.

After a successful surgery in July 2012, I faced the challenge of living with facial palsy, a condition caused by damage to my facial nerve during the operation. Among the symptoms were a droopy left side of my face, loss of hearing in the left ear, loss of taste, and a permanently open left eye that I had to close with tape at night to prevent it from drying out. Despite trying various treatments, including facial massages and electric impulse therapy, my condition did not improve. Eventually, I was referred to Raman Malhotra, a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the Queen Victoria Hospital. He suggested implanting a platinum chain inside my eyelid to help it close automatically, boosting my confidence and improving my overall quality of life. The procedure was a success, and I have noticed significant improvements since then. However, facial palsy can affect various parts of the face and body, from loss of taste and hearing to dry mouth, difficulty speaking, and muscle weakness. While many patients can recover within eight weeks, Lauren's facial nerve was too badly damaged to regain function. To provide a more effective solution, Malhotra helped design a platinum chain implant that weighed just enough to allow her eyelid to close when gravity took effect. This innovative treatment, which uses individual platinum links connected by nylon, has shown promising results in clinical studies at Queen Victoria Hospital and could potentially become the gold standard for treating facial palsy patients with unresponsive eyelids. While most stroke patients do not experience facial weakness, around 100,000 people in the UK have facial palsy, and the condition can result from a variety of causes, including viral infections and traumatic injury. Recent studies suggest that platinum implants may be superior to traditional gold implants due to their durability, cosmetic appearance, and lack of irritation, making them a more patient-friendly alternative. Despite the initial higher cost, the long-term benefits and the potential for fewer postoperative complications may outweigh the investment.\", ' However she was allegedly injured on May 20, 2013 when she allegedly experienced pain in her right wrist whilst checking harnesses on the Tower of Terror thrill ride.

After being recruited from his job at ICI, he produced a report called Reshaping of British Railways - a document which changed the face of British railways forever. At the time, railway lines were extensive across Britain and even very remote areas had stations. But, with the industry hemorrhaging money, Dr Beeching's solution was to close down the parts - including stations and lines - which did not make money. He recommended axing about one third of the network, which equated to around 5,000 miles of track. This included hundreds of branch lines, 2,363 stations and tens of thousands of jobs lost on the grounds of cost or efficiency. His recommendations left Britain with 13,721 miles of railway lines in 1966, while a further 2,000 miles were lost by the end of the 1960s. Dr Beeching argued it was more important to invest in fast journeys between the cities and to replace some branch lines with improved bus services. However, many critics failed to recognise that the government had already cut 3,000 miles of track before Dr Beeching's input, something which was continued by successive governments. <SENTENCE_MASK> The Beeching Axe, as the report came to be known, caused widespread outrage and controversy, with many people arguing that it disproportionately affected rural communities and ignored the social benefits of having rail access.

'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit.

There are plenty of ways by which companies can market to kids or adults outside of TV advertising and the regulations for non-broadcast advertising are currently weak or non-existent. Our children seem to spend an increasing amount of time online, actively engaging in social media, and the junk food and drink manufacturers are busy providing games, social networking apps, and other tools to promote their brands in cyberspace where the adults often fear to tread. A study by the Children's Food Campaign, of 100 websites featuring food likely to be bought or requested by children, found that more than 80 per cent of online adverts were associated with foods classed as less healthy and therefore not allowed to be advertised during children's TV programmes. Yet more than 75 per cent featured child-friendly characters, competitions, downloads, and links to social media apps that directly engaged with kids.

According to a survey of 1,000 adults by Alfresia.co.uk, almost 40% of participants spent more time sunbathing and having barbecues compared to gardening. Sir Roy Strong, a landscape designer and former V&A Museum director, noted that British people once took pride in well-maintained gardens filled with flowers, but now prefer to unwind in their gardens with a glass of wine after work. This shift in priorities can also be seen in the growing popularity of hot tubs and outdoor spas: one in ten households now owns one, and sales increase in colder years.

Instead, it is important to act fast and grab a bottle of the nearest high-proof clear liquor to tackle the stain.

The soldier had asked his victim to go upstairs to talk and she agreed because her feet were hurting after dancing in high heels. But instead of talking, Khoorban raped her violently. The attack was so violent that the teenager had to be rushed to the hospital to be treated for her injuries. The court also heard that after the first rape, Khoorban went on to rape another woman in Greenwich, south east London, two months later. He did this while armed with a knife and threatened to harm her if she resisted. The court noted that Khoorban had a history of violence within the army, including biting off a comrade\\'s earlobe and breaking his nose, hitting another soldier in the face, and punching a third soldier so hard that he lost consciousness. However, he had not faced any charges for these offenses. Khoorban was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depression several years after the attacks but acknowledged that he was not suffering from these conditions at the time of the attacks in 2003.

The study compares the color associations of synesthetes to the colors used in the Fisher-Price magnet set and found that for participants born between 1970 and 1985, the prevalence of synesthesia apparently learned from the Fisher-Price set can exceed 15 percent. The authors of the study suggest that the findings indicate that external factors, such as exposure to the Fisher-Price magnets, can influence the letter-color pairings of synesthetes, and that this conditioned mental imagery is a possible explanation for synesthesia. However, they also note that there may have been other cues, such as cultural influences or other popular toys or magnet sets, that played a role. The findings do not suggest that colorful toys cause synesthesia, but rather that the associations of people already predisposed to the condition can be influenced by external factors.\", ' Gibson and his tracker were attempting to assess the ivory of the young bull elephant when the animal charged and tragically crushed Gibson to death.', \" Lundie was arrested seven days later when the stolen car was seen speeding away from officers at 100mph in Erdington, Birmingham but was later released.

However, Shanay soon became the victim of regular punishments by Morris, and her mother, Juanila Smikle - Shanay's grandmother. She was disciplined for tiny misdemeanours such as failing to eat quickly enough or 'fighting' while brushing her teeth. The court was told that Shanay faced a range of abuse including being placed in the bath and having water thrown over her, being forced to stand on a landing for 20 minutes, and having the palms of her outstretched hands 'whacked' with a hairbrush. On one occasion, neighbours saw Morris refuse to let Shanay go to the toilet and instead taunted her with the song: 'I know a song that will get on your nerves'. Neighbours described Morris as a 'very strict' parent who frequently made her niece cry by shouting at her. Shanay was often 'hysterical' at times, had 'lost her sparkle' after moving in with Morris, and went from being a 'bubbly' child when her aunt wasn't around to 'introverted and anxious' when she was nearby. Teachers at Shanay's primary school had noticed injuries to her, which were recorded in Safeguarding Referral forms and then shown to a social worker.

The remains of Mary Jane, 34, and their children, Zach, four, Sadie, three, and Madison, two, were all found either in bags or suitcases that had been weighed down and thrown in rivers. As soon as the bodies were found, Longo became the prime suspect. But he had already disappeared south of the border and assumed the identity of a New York Times journalist named Mike Finkel, who had been fired for fabricating a character in a piece about the African slave trade. Longo remained at large until the FBI transferred him stateside and arrested him in California. He was found guilty after a month-long trial and sentenced to death. True Story is based on Finkel's experiences and the unlikely friendship he struck up with Longo while researching the story. What unfolds is a complex relationship as Finkel meets Franco's Longo, an Oregon man awaiting trial for brutally killing his wife and three children. The two men find common ground in writing but the dynamic wavers as each man struggles with his search for intellectual credibility. Finkel told People: 'The scariest thing about him is that there is nothing scary about him. He's a witty, very intelligent guy, and I'm still completely flummoxed by what drove him. I don't believe in the death penalty, but I believe he belongs exactly where he is. He's despicable to the core.' In preparation for the film, Franco dined with Jonah Hill in New York, but in a recent interview with his former employer, conducted after he had seen the film, Finkel claimed some of the scenes had been fabricated. He also visited the set once as Longo's trial was being recreated, an experience he admitted was traumatic. Finkel told the Times: 'It brought back some very uncomfortable flashbacks. I never forget at the heart of this story is three murdered children and a murdered wife. That's the nature of this material - it's tragic, creepy and compelling.'

The new research revealed that between 1989 and 2008 almost three quarters of popular UK box office films depicted alcohol use – but only six per cent were classified as adult only. The results revealed that children who had watched the most alcohol scenes were almost two-and-a-half times more likely to have a drink more than once per week. They were also twice as likely to have alcohol-related problems than those less exposed. The study concluded that the current rating system was not adequate for parents trying to limit their children's exposure to drinking. Dr Waylen added: 'My guess is there needs to be a level of identification with the drinker in the film. Kids are more likely to identify with consuming characters in films where alcohol use is made to look cool, get you friends, win the girl or boy. Adults may not realize the extent to which their children are being exposed to alcohol consumption in films, and this could contribute to unhealthy drinking behavior.

However, even these renowned chefs acknowledged that France's influence in mid-to-low range restaurants, particularly in tourist areas like Mont Saint Michel and along the Seine, had let the country down. They recommended stricter criteria for food labeled as 'homemade' and admitted that France's global culinary influence 'is no longer the same'. A 2014 survey by catering union Synhorcat suggested that 31% of restaurants (excluding cafeterias, bars, and fast food outlets) used industrially prepared foods, but Xavier Denamur, who exposed the issue in his book, claimed the figure was as high as seven in ten dishes served in cafes, brasseries, and bistros. The new 'fait maison' label, which was intended to promote traditional cooking and establishments that cook from scratch, faced criticism for not going far enough as restaurants were still able to use pre-made ingredients and claim the food was homemade. The rising cost of raw materials and staff may make it difficult for many restaurants to cook from scratch. A traditional boeuf bourguignon costs around 7.50 Euros to produce, but it is often cheaper for chefs to buy frozen ingredients and ready-made dishes from industrial producers such as Transgourmet, Métro, Brake, or Davigel. In an effort to promote French gastronomy, the French ministry recently launched the Good France project, which saw 1,000 chefs of different nationalities serve French food and wine in restaurants and embassies across five continents as part of its national 'gastrono-diplomacy' drive.

Born in 1853, Rhodes made his fortune in diamond mines and entered politics as an outspoken supporter of colonialism. He later founded Rhodesia, now modern-day Zimbabwe, which was named after him. Rhodes believed in the superiority of the English race and envisioned drawing a \"red line\" railway from Cairo to Cape Town for the British Empire. While his supporters argue that he brought political and physical infrastructure to South Africa, his detractors believe his actions laid the foundation for apartheid by restricting the rights of black Africans to work.

A Philadelphia court heard Thursday that Corry 'Corey' Campbell, 21, was the ringleader of the gang, who have become known as the 'tattoo terrorists'. Campbell was jailed for 20 years after he discovered that the victim, Greg Valecce, had hurt his cat, Pebbles. Campbell, his girlfriend Sandra Ng, 19, and friend Carl Halin, 18, cornered Valecce in the basement and took turns punching, slapping and spitting on him. They filmed the abuse, with the video played in court this week. The trio, described by the paper as 'wannabe gangsters', believed Valecce had also stolen money and some weed. After Valecce was beaten, they tied him to a chair and Campbell tattooed 'RIP Pebbles' onto his right arm along with a smiley face that had breasts for eyes and a penis for a nose. Halin then took over the tattoo gun and inked swastikas, Stars of David, two variations of the N-word and a penis ejaculating on a rainbow with the words 'Gay Pride' beside it on his body. Valecce suffered three busted ribs, two broken wrists and fractured bones in his face. He was able to escape on April 1 while the others slept and contact police. The incident lasted about 42 hours. During a search of the house, police allegedly found a tattoo gun, needles, ink vials and related paraphernalia, along with 155 grams of marijuana, several bottles of prescription drugs and Valecce's debit card, which he claimed had been stolen from him. Valecce has since had the tattoos removed, but says the incident has left him with irrevocable damage. 'I'm scared to go outside now,' Valecce told Common Pleas Court Judge Charles Ehrlich Thursday.

These incidents underscore the growing concern about indiscipline in schools and the significant risk that teachers face in their daily work. Under the Health and Safety At Work Act 1974, employers must ensure, as far as reasonably practical, that employees are protected.

This phenomenon is referred to as 'digital seasoning.' Using classical music in experimentation, Professor Charles Spence found that humans tend to match the same sounds to the same tastes. He described sourness as 'high-pitched,' meaning it should be played alongside music of the same quality. Sweetness is associated with richer sounds, and bitterness with deeper tones. However, finding the perfect sound to enhance salty tastes remains a challenge. Spence's research involves giving people two pieces of identical chocolate and asking them to eat one while listening to a different piece of classical music. The more somber music tends to result in people describing the chocolate as more bitter, while an upbeat piece often results in them perceiving it as sweeter.

Although pilots are used to this type of approach, it does result in a very interesting view out of the window for passengers.'

As a result, the area is popular with plane spotters and many of the surrounding bars and restaurants on the beach display airline departure and arrival timetables. The plane landings at Saint Martin's Princess Juliana International Airport have become legendary worldwide.

Furthermore, the union's grip on Labour's organization is extensive, with over 150 Labour MPs and 133 candidates having links to Unite.

And studies have shown that sleep is critical in converting short-term memories into long-term memory, a process known as memory consolidation. A team of scientists at Brandeis University in Massachusetts believe all-nighters to cram before an exam won\\'t work because the process converting short-term memory to long-term memory is best carried out when a person is asleep. But just how that process works has remained a mystery. One body of thinking questions whether the mechanism that promotes sleep is also responsible for consolidating memory. While another asks if the two distinct processes work together. In other words, is memory consolidated during sleep because the brain is quiet, allowing memory neurons to go to work, or are memory neurons actually putting us to sleep? Graduate students, Paula Haynes and Bethany Christmann, at the university\\'s Griffith Lab, believe the answer is the latter. They focused their research on dorsal paired median neurons, well-known memory consolidators in fruit flies. The pair noted, for the first time, that when the neurons are activated, the flies slept more, but when they were deactivated, the flies kept buzzing. These memory consolidators cause the flies to fall asleep, as they begin to convert short-term memory to long-term memory. This takes place in a section of the fly\\'s brain called the mushroom body, which is similar to the hippocampus in humans, where our memories are stored. The parts of the fly\\'s mushroom body, which is responsible for memory and learning, is the same part that keeps it awake. The hippocampus in the brain, highlighted in red, is where our memories are stored, and where, the scientists believe, the process takes place. Ms. Christmann said: \"It\\'s almost as if that section of the mushroom body were saying, \\'hey, stay awake and learn this\\'. Then, after a while, the DPM neurons start signaling to suppress that section, as if to say, \\'you\\'re going to need sleep if you want to remember this later\\'.\" Understanding how sleep and memory are connected in a simple system, like fruit flies, can help scientists unravel the secrets of the human brain. \"Knowing that sleep and memory overlap in the fly brain can allow researchers', ' Age: 44; Former Atlanta public school SRT Director\\n\\nVERDICT: GUILTY of violation of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\\n\\nSENTENCE: Seven years in prison, 13 years probation, 2,000 hours of community service and a $25,000 fine.\\n\\nSharon Davis-Williams.', ' The FHP is now investigating whether cars at the private track are set up to travel in the opposite, clockwise direction of the guardrails.', \" 'I thought that once they were made aware that I had my own kids that they were going to take them from me.'\", ' Mouth ulcers that persist for more than three weeks, especially if they are multiple and painful, warrant further investigation to rule out underlying conditions such as deficiencies or bowel diseases.', \" The video sees the four leaders, all dressed in matching suits and singing harmoniously, proclaim how 'a vote for me is the same as a vote for any of us guys', emphasizing their shared commitment to austerity measures, public service cuts, and support for fracking.\", \" According to Lord Ashcroft's polling, the squeeze on Ukip's vote has been the most significant movement across the board in the 10 marginal seats, with the UKIP share falling significantly - by up to ten points - in nine of the ten seats polled.\", ' Iran, a Shiite nation, is backing the rebel group in Yemen.', ' With its vast collection of chef recommendations for various diningoptions, Where Chefs Eat is a must-have app for foodies.

Just a few weeks ago David Cameron admitted he couldn't live on a zero-hours contract. But the Tories seem happy for working people to be stuck in low-paid zero-hour contract jobs. It's becoming increasingly clear throughout this campaign that they will only stand up for a privileged few. The reality – that the Tories refused to acknowledge – is that for too many people zero-hours contracts leave them without a regular income and not knowing from one day to the next how much work they will get. The number of people with zero-hour contracts has increased by almost 20% in the last year and surveys show that over half of young people on these contracts are on them because they could not find a job with regular hours. Companies such as Sports Direct are hiring the vast majority of their workers on zero-hours contracts, even though they have predictable and manageable fluctuations in demand and many of these employees reportedly work regular hours in practice. This is insecurity dressed up as flexibility. It's not acceptable, it's not fair, and Labour will act to stop it. Labour will ban exploitative zero-hours contracts.

AGP is Malaga Airport, which didn't want to take its first three letters from the city name as 'mal' means bad in Spanish.

LOL in the spirit of unusual acronyms, the term usually used in text messages to signify 'laugh out loud' is actually Derby Field airport in Nevada, serving Lovelock City (hence the code).

The locals reported seeing the plane's distinctive red and blue markings, and some even claimed that it was travelling north to southeast and so low that they could make out the doors. Given the considerable size and weight of a jumbo jet, it is reasonable to assume that a crash in that area could have produced detectable underwater sounds.

With soil and water contaminated, nobody can live there yet, and it is unknown when the clean-up mission will be completed. Reports found that few cancers would be expected as a result of accumulated radiation exposures, although people in the area worst affected by the accident may have a slightly higher risk of developing certain cancers such as leukemia, solid cancers, thyroid cancer and breast cancer. Surveys show only a fifth of former residents want to return to living in the area. The plant has six reactors, three of which were offline when disaster struck on March 11, 2011. More than 300,000 people had to be evacuated after three of Fukushima's six reactors blew up following the huge tsunami which devastated the country over three years ago. Nearly 16,000 people lost their lives in the natural disaster and subsequent devastation. A magnitude-9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami which swept into the plant and knocked out its backup power and cooling systems, leading to meltdowns at the three active reactors. The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission found the nuclear disaster was 'manmade' and that its direct causes were all foreseeable. It stated that it had also failed to meet the most basic safety requirements, such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans. Decommissioning and dismantling all six reactors is a delicate, time-consuming process that includes removing the melted fuel from a highly radioactive environment, as well as all the extra fuel rods, which sit in cooling pools at the top of the reactor buildings. Workers, who wear protective suits when dismantling the plant, must determine the exact condition of the melted fuel debris and develop remote-controlled and radiation-resistant robotics to deal with it.

The Rosetta probe, illustrated, which carried the Philae lander, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. it chased comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014 . The region of the comet where this jet erupted from is known as Imhotep. By 7:17am BST (2:17am EST), the region had rotated into sunlight, and the jet was no longer visible against the overexposed coma. This means scientists aren't sure if the eruption was short-lived, or was a continuous jet. ‘Usually, 67P’s dust-jets are rather long-lived,’ said Dr Vincent. ‘Most of them last for a full dayside rotation of approximately six hours and even reappear in the next rotation.’ Rosetta is continuing to study comet 67P ahead of its closest approach to the sun in August.

The controversy over a Saturday Night Live (SNL) skit depicting a male student having sex with his female high school teacher as every teen boy's dream sparked intense criticism on social media, highlighting the serious consequences and potential trauma experienced by male victims of sexual abuse by female educators.\\n\\n<SENTENCE\\\\_MASK>\\n\\nII. An SNL spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.\\n\\nIII. There is no central U.S. reporting system for tracking female teachers who prey on male students, but research by Terry Abbott has indicated that these cases are on the rise and that there are more women police officers and greater awareness leading to increased prosecution. According to Abbott's data, there were 26 cases of female school employees accused of inappropriate relationships with male students in January 2023, compared to 19 cases in January 2022.\\n\\nIV. Gender-neutral approaches to addressing the issue have become increasingly prevalent in the education system and beyond, with a growing recognition that students are adversely affected regardless of the gender of the perpetrator or victim. The consequences of sexual abuse by a female teacher can include depression, low self-esteem, difficulty maintaining relationships, confusion, guilt, and long-term psychological trauma.\\n\\nV. Female educators who engage in such acts are increasingly facing tougher legal consequences. In recent weeks, notable cases such as Danielle Watkins, Kathryn Ronk, and Nicole Dufault have seen female prosecutors and judges apply similar standards to the sentencing of these offenders, rejecting any potential double standard and upholding the importance of setting clear boundaries and maintaining a professional relationship between teachers and students.\\n\\nVI. The changing societal narrative surrounding this issue can be seen through the reactions to the April 2023 SNL skit, which depicted a male judge fist-bumping a boy who had sex with his 'hot' teacher. The Twitter backlash to this portrayal of the situation highlights the growing awareness and recognition of the severity and long-term impact of the abuse female teachers inflict on their students.\", ' The UK had initially planned to switch off its FM service by 2018 but the plans were later abandoned due to objections from commercial radio stations and are now not expected to happen until sometime after 2020.', \" Users can then switch them on during the day to use the home's stored electricity instead of drawing power from the grid.\", ' The spectator who secured the footage shared it on Vine, and it has since gained over one million hits.', \" The auction takes place on April 28 and the items will be available to view the day before.

Immigration should be about welcoming those who can contribute to our country; who want to come to Britain, pay their way, make a life here, and abide by British values. This is our approach. And this presents you with a clear choice on immigration on May 7. There can only be one Prime Minister in Number Ten, only one person ultimately responsible for controlling immigration: me, or Ed Miliband. Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased five-fold. His arrogant refusal even to discuss numbers – let alone speak about any reduction – tells you all you need to know. But the facts of this election have changed – and it’s even worse. The only way Ed Miliband can get into Downing Street is if he is propped up by the SNP – and they have made clear that they want higher levels of immigration. It’s clear: Ed Miliband in Downing Street would increase immigration, not reduce it. And if you’re someone considering voting Ukip because you want a referendum on Europe and controlled immigration, remember that a vote for Ukip makes it harder for Conservatives to win – and much more likely for Ed Miliband and the SNP to get into government. Then you will get no referendum, and a return to uncontrolled immigration. So this is the choice. If I am Prime Minister after May 7 I will see through this serious, sustained attempt to control immigration long-term. I will get Britain a better deal in Europe – and I will give the British people the final say in an in-out referendum.

She noted that when she was a teenager she too would have been deemed underweight because BMI calculations don't take age, sex or genetic body shape into account. 'At 16, when I was working as a fashion model, I weighed 115 pounds and was 5’7” 1/2,' she wrote. 'I exercised regularly and really loved to eat Subway veggie sandwiches and drink McDonald’s vanilla milkshakes.' She continued: 'I was not anorexic or starving - I was simply a naturally thin teenager with a powerful teenage metabolic system.' Jennifer noted that as a teen with a BMI of 18.0, she would most certainly have been considered 'underweight'; while the exact BMI requirements for models working in France have not been released, the World Health Organization considers people with a BMI below 18.5 to be underweight and at risk of being malnourished. And while Jennifer says that, 22 years later her current measurements finally put her at a 'normal' 21.0, her BMI for most of her modeling career would have been deemed too dangerous for her to work under the new laws. While the model rights activist applauded the French government for attempting to protect the health of 'these young working professionals', she and Lauren both agreed that outlawing thin altogether is not the answer. 'I think a better solution is to raise the age limit for models to 18,' Lauren told Jennifer. 'Many ultra-thin models are simply still going through puberty, and allowing their bodies to form before their career would be beneficial to all.' Jennifer added that instead of putting restrictions on the size of young models, the French government should 'look to the modeling agencies who freely act as employment agencies without the responsibilities of treating their client-models as working professionals'. Because models are considered independent contractors in the US, standard employment laws, which allow workers mandatory breaks, compensation for injuries and protection from sexual harassment, do not apply. Sara Ziff, who is a model and founder of The Model Alliance organization, told Think Progress in March that she is also against the new French law because legislating body mass standards is not the same thing as the fashion industry promoting a 'healthy ideal'.\", ' Based on the article above, the predicted missing sentence is:\\n\\nThe main parties are evenly split when voters are asked who they would consider backing on May 7, with 48% saying Labour and 47% Conservative.', \" The discovery of Neanderthal tools at their habitation sites indicates their advanced skills as tool makers, with evidence of bone tools dating back 60,000 years and a large building made from mammoth bones and decorated with carvings and pigments found at 44,000 years ago.

Ben Wizner, an ACLU lawyer representing Edward Snowden, stated that he was not against lenient sentences, as long as such treatment is applied equally. He commented, 'The problem is not that David Petraeus is getting lenient treatment. The problem is that lenient treatment is only available to people in high places.' Petraeus was also granted certain conditions for his probation, such as international travel approval and firearm possession. He has 14 days to file an appeal if he wishes to challenge the sentencing.\\n\\nIn the earlier agreement, prosecutors alleged that in 2011, Petraeus provided Broadwell with eight binders of classified material that he had improperly retained as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Afterwards, he returned the binders to his Arlington, Virginia, house. The confidential information found in the so-called 'black books' consisted of covert operative names, the coalition war strategy, and notes on Petraeus' discussions with President Obama and the National Security Council. However, the FBI discovered these binders during an April 2013 search of Petraeus' house, which contained them in an unlocked desk drawer on the ground floor. After resigning from the CIA, Petraeus had signed a false statement affirming that he had no covered material. He also lied to FBI agents, stating that he had not provided the information to Broadwell.\\n\\nPetraeus served as commander of U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and was brought in by President George W. Bush for the crucial period when the war began to turn in favor of the U.S. During his tenure, Petraeus was responsible for coordinating the multinational forces in Iraq as well as the 'surge' of American troops and the Sunni tribal alliance plan, which allowed the U.S. military to withdraw in 2011.

Had he been found guilty, he could have faced up to ten years in prison. After the verdict, Mr. Rayhons tearfully said, 'the truth finally came out.' 'Donna's love for me never changed from the day that we got married to the day she passed away,' he expressed. 'It was always the same. She knew me all the time. She just was a lady who wanted to be loved.' The case raised significant issues regarding consent when one spouse is diagnosed with dementia. Defense attorney arguments suggested that a guilty verdict could instill apprehension, potentially restricting interactions between couples. Prosecutors insisted a not guilty verdict could potentially endanger future dementia patients. Mr. and Mrs. Rayhons had married seven years earlier, having both been widowed from prior relationships. They met at a church choir, and Mr. Rayhons later learned his wife's hobby of beekeeping while Mrs. Rayhons accompanied her husband to the statehouse.\\n\\nIn response to the allegations, Mr. Rayhons decided not to run for a tenth term in the Iowa House of Representatives. Mrs. Rayhons was moved into a nursing home in Garner in March the previous year due to her dementia.

Court records indicated that, about a week later, on May 23, Henry Rayhons allegedly entered his wife's room, pulled the curtains around her bed, and had sexual contact. A roommate testified to observing suspicious movements but was uncertain about the nature of the encounter. However, she acknowledged that she could only hear noises and did not witness anything directly.\\n\\nAn examination of Donna Rayhons on the night of the incident found no signs of injury, and laboratory results from swabs taken during the exam showed no definitive evidence of recent sexual activity.

Alongside him Roberto Pereyra faded after a bright opening and Morata’s contribution was the incident which led to Juventus being awarded their penalty. Before that Pirlo had patrolled the centre of Juve’s midfield with his usual classy touches, prodding around without being able to influence the tie in a way that he would have wanted. Even so they failed to score in the opening 45 minutes because Vidal, usually so dependable in this Juve team, could not find the target. Everything was wayward, earning a deserved rebuke from Tevez when he screwed wildly over the crossbar of Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic. Pirlo gave him the eyes after he missed another chance, streaking down the left before his right foot shot flew into the stands. In many way this was a subdued Juve performance, falling short of the standards they set when they beat Borussia Dortmund 5-1 on aggregate in the second round. Expectations have been raised.

As he puts it: 'There are all kinds of reasons to believe there are different neural systems in the brain of males and females.' That is, our brains process pain differently because our brains are different: our varying ability to withstand pain is proof. He thinks it is unfortunate that much basic pain research has, until recently, been done in male animals. Although men were more inclined to give themselves the benefit of the doubt, the majority, 54 per cent, still agreed ‘women’ were more stoical. But is this right? One way to find out is to get male and female volunteers to take part in a cold water immersion test. This is a standard pain test widely used because it causes acute pain without doing any long-term damage (as long as you don’t do it for more than 15 minutes).\", \" Photographers lined the water's shore to take the perfect shot of the rare bird.\", \" Vian told Luxottica shareholders that his company is 'now working on Google Glass version 2 which is in preparation'.\", ' Many visitors had already booked return journeys but had crowded outside the airport in the hope of boarding the next available flight back to India.

Some landlords may evict tenants to sell their homes or for other reasons, and many buy-to-let properties could be excluded from the proposal altogether due to mortgage requirements. This, in turn, could discourage investment in new homes and ultimately force up rents in the long term. Opponents argue that the way to tackle the housing crisis is to build more homes, and warn that rent controls will suppress house building and worsen the situation.
